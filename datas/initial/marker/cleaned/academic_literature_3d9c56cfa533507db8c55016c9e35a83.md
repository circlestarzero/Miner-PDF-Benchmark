## Abstract

Six highbush blueberries were introduced into New Zealand from North America in 1950. A further introduction of 10 cultivars was made in 1973.

Development of the industry has been rapid since 1975.

There are currently more than 400 ha planted, comprising 4 main cultivars.

Production in 1983 was 150 tonnes, with a marked peak during late December to mid-January. Research concentrated on plant propagation and selection during the industry establishment phase.  Recently, emphasis has been placed on evaluation of berry characteristics, yield and fruit season of a range of cultivars. Fruit size and yield have important implications in relation to volume of exportable fruit.  Fruit season influences are reflected in market opportunities.

Fruit production and berry sizes in New Zealand compare more than favourably with Northern Hemisphere experience.  Cultivar Dixi, for example, 11 years from planting, produced 12.6 kg/plant, average berry size 1.6 g. Season of all cultivars is influenced by latitude. Present research programmes on blueberries in New Zealand cover a wide range of management activities.

## History Of Blueberry Industry In New Zealand

Highbush (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) and Rabbiteye (Vaccinium ashei Reade) blueberries were first introduced into New Zealand in 1950.

Initial plantings were made of 6 highbush cultivars (Atlantic, Burlington, Concord, Dixi, Jersey and Stanley), and 3 rabbiteye cultivars
(Calloway, Clara and Meyers), in consolidated peat. Growth and berry production of highbush cultivars was sufficiently encouraging for further plantings to be made in 1965. Planting of rabbiteye cultivars was not expanded.

Introductions of a further 10 highbush cultivars, Berkeley, Bluecrop, Blue Ray, Collins, Coville, Darrow, Early Blue, Herbert, Ivanhoe and Rubel, were made in 1973, as well as the rabbiteye cultivars Carden Blue, Tif Blue and Woodard (Van der Elst, 1978). At present 40 cultivars have been imported either by Government Research Stations or by private growers (Lund, 1980).

Until Development of the New Zealand blueberry industry was slow.

1975 there were only 2 ha of commercial plantings in the North Island of New Zealand. Rapid development of the industry has taken place By 1979, 14 ha of blueberries were planted;  by 1981 the area since.

Acts Horticulturae 165, 1985 Vaccinium Culture 10.35 increased to 259 ha; presently 400 ha have been established (Pranklin, pers. com. 1984). At least 68X of plantings are in the Waikato district
(Figure 1) of the North Island (Langford, 1982).

The New Zealand industry is based primarily on 4 North American highbush cultivars, Atlantic (26%), Jersey (24%), Dixi (20%), and Burlington Other cultivars in commercial plantings are Stanley, Herbert,
( 197 ).

Blue Ray, Berkeley, Early Blue, Collins, Rubel, Darrow and the rabbiteye Tif Blue (Langford, 1982).

Production has risen steadily from 18 tonnes in 1973 to 150 tonnes in 1983, of which 73 tonnes was exported. The main markets for New Zealand fruit are USA (63%), EEC (20%), and Australia (12.5%) (Langford, 1982).

The industry appears to be entering a consolidation phase.

Rate of erpansion of plantings is decreasing. Projections are for 2,050 tonnes of fruit by 1987/88 (Langford, 1982).

The major research effort on blueberries in New Zealand is carried out at Ruakura Soil & Plant Research Station in the Waikato.  Early work was concentrated on propagation methods and selection of cultivars.

Selection criteria vere suitability for machine harvesting, and productivity (Van der Elst, 1978). Only two selections made in these early programmes, 'A9' (a selection from cultivar Jersey), and 'Cll' (a selection from cultivar Stanley) are grown commercially.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, research has expanded to cover a range of production-related topics. Programmes include chemical weed control (James, 1980; Rahman et al., 1982), chemical bird repellants
(Holland et al., 1980, 1981; Sorrenson and Holland, 1981), effects of mycorrhizal fungi on growth in both mursery and field plants (Powell and Bates, 1981;  Powell, 1982), pruning (Poll, 1983), selection of early season cultivars (Poll and Wood, 1983), harvesting requirements (Poll, 1981), processing uses (Poll and Wood, 1983), mechanised grading, control of fruit season using ripening agents, evaluation of cultivars for productivity, production season and fruit quality (Poll and Wood, 1982, 1983).

## Productivity Of Blueberries In New Zealand

The performance and characteristics of blueberries in New Zealand is best described from three trials. These vere designed to provide compa­ risons between North American highbush cultivars under New Zealand conditions, and to enable evaluation of some local selections. From information gained on fruit season, fruit characteristics and productivity, it is now possible to provide guidance for future plantings to maximise profitability for New Zealand blueberry growers.

The first two trials were planted on virgin peat, pR 3.8. Fertiliser
(4:1:1 - serpentine superphosphate:sulphate of ammonia:sulphate of potash) was applied in October each year at 25 g/plant for the first 3 years, 75 g/plant for years 3 to 6, and 100 g/plant from year 7.

Additional sulphate of ammonia at 25 g/plant was applied in November each year.  Fungicide and pesticide spray schedules were maintained in accordance with export regulations. Low branches and old non-productive branches were pruned out to maintain an open structure for ease of picking and to maximise sunlight penetration.

In the third trial, growth and production of selected indicator cultivars was monitored in several districts. Trial: 1:
Comparison of standard highbush blueberry cultivars and early New Zealand selections.

## Method

Four seedling selections (coded A9, D14, Cll and Al6), and 3 named cultivars (Dixi, Burlington and Jersey) vere planted in 1973 in six replicates of 3 plants per cultivar in randomised blocks.

Inter-row spacing was 3.6 m, and between-plant spacing was 0.6 m (4630 plants/ha).

Four years after establishment, plant population was reduced by one plant per plot to 3086 plants/ha.  A further reduction of one plant per plot was carried out 3 years later as bushes reached maturity, resulting in a final plant population of 1543 plants/ha. Fruit weights were recorded from 1976/77 each season (3½ years from field planting) until 1983/84. For the 1981/82 and 1982/83 harvests, average berry weights and percent fruit soluble solids, were recorded. Average berry weights were determined from 100 berries sampled at random at each harvest.

Percent soluble solids was measured using a hand-held refractometer and extract from 10 berries sampled at random at each harvest.

## Results And Discussion

Yields obtained for standard cultivars compared favourably with those recorded in Northern Eemisphere countries (Dijkstra, 1977;  Liebster and Schimmelpfeng, 1977;  Lamb, 1977;  Eck and Childers, 1969).  Accumulative total yield per ha over 8 seasons ranged from 73.9 t/ha for Al6, to 119.3 t/ha for Dixi (Table 1).

Increase in yield over the first 4 years from close planting, ranged from 22.5 t/ha for Al6, to 34.4 t/ha for A9. Additional production from close planting over the first 4 production seasons = [(Y x3)+(IT 2 x2)]-
(Y x + E Y 2 ~ ), where Y x = first yield per plant, and E Y 2 ~ , = total yield of second, third and fourth year production per plant (Table 1), expressed as tonnes per hectare. Depending on the cost of plant material as well as labour requirements for initial planting and subsequent removal of plants in later years, extra income could be gained from initial high plant densities. Average berry weights measured in 2 seasons ranged from 0.9 g for A9 and up to 1.6 g for Dixi. Soluble solids varied betveen harvest within variety; the highest was recorded for A9 (13.3X),
and lowest for Jersey (11.5X).

## Performance Of 14 Highbush Cultivars. Trial 2: Hethod

'Fourteen highbush cultivars (Dixi, Herbert, Berkeley, Blue Ray, Bluecrop, Darrow, Rubel, Stanley, Jersey, Early Blue, Collins, Ivanhoe, Coville and Atlantic) were planted in 1978. Six replicates of each cultivar, inter-row spacing 4 m and intra-row spacing 1.75 m (1428 plants/
ha), were planted in randomised blocks.   Yields were recorded for each plant from 1979/80 season.  Average berry weights were measured at each harvest from 1981/82.

The late-maturing cultivars Dixi and Herbert consistently produced higher per-plant yields than the early-maturing cultivars Early Blue and Collins (Table 2). Performance of North American highbush cultivars in this trial compares favourably with production recorded in North America (Table 3). Similarly, fruit sizes were equivalent to or higher than those reported by Moore', 1970; Moore et al., 1972, Liebster and Schimmelpfeng, 1977, but lower than those reported by Nelson, 1982.

Average berry veights ranged from 2.1 g for Darrow, down to 1.0 g for Rubel.

Trial 3:
Fruit season of 3 cultivars in four North Island Districts.

## Method

Production was monitored for an early cultivar (Early Blue), a midseason cultivar (Atlantic), and a late cultivar (Dixi), in four districts in the North Island of New Zealand:  Northland (northern North Island);  Waikato/Bay of Plenty (central North Island);  Taranaki (south western North Island), and Borowhenua (southern North Island).

## Results And Discussion

Results for the 1982/83 season show clearly that ripening is affected by latitude (Figure 1). These regional influences are of significance in planning the future development of the fresh fruit export industry.

At present the bulk of fruit ripens from late December until late January. This has been identified as a difficult marketing period.

By structuring plantings, the season in each region can be extended, and the impact of post-Christmas market depression minimised. CONCLUSIONS
A preference for large berries on international markets is reported by New Zealand exporters. On the basis of berry size, Darrow, Berkeley, Ivanhoe, Collins, Herbert, Early Blue, Coville and Dixi are the most suitable cultivars for fresh export.  Of these cultivars, those which fruit during the most desirable production season for Waikato/Bay of Plenty districts in New Zealand are Herbert, Darrow, Dixi, Early Blue and Collins.

Further trials are needed to evaluate production seasons of more recent introductions, and to assess productivity of new early and late selections. These will increase the range of early and late cultivars available for grovers to maximise production during the most profitable periods for the New Zealand industry.
