Female sexual function is a difficult entity to be assessed. Subjective factors and interview biases can change the perception of it. Using validated questionnaires can improve the scientific approach to this matter. There is a huge difference of severity and incidence among young, apparent healthy women, which are in a harmonious relationship. We evaluated 320 healthy women, with stable sexual active relationship, with no know depressive disease, endocrinological and metabolic pathology, no premature menopause, no malignancy. We compose a mathematic model to study the impact of age, and body weight on the sexual function, with FSFI total score as surrogate marker. We observed that even in healthy women, increase in age and/or weight/body mass significantly impair general sexual function.

## Introduction

Female sexual dysfunction is present in all age groups, mostly increasing with age [2]. The dysfunction is altering the quality of life months before the clinical signs are obvious.

The dysfunction is affecting at least two domains of the normal sexual parameters: desire, central and or peripheral arousal, orgasm, global satisfaction and presence of pain [1]. The approved tool to diagnose, investigate and quantify the sexual function in women is the Females Sexual Function Index - FSFI [7].

Generally organic diseases, endocrine dysfunctions, premature ovarian failure, surgical interventions, previous cancers or depression are considered to impair sexual function in women [8]. It is difficult to know which of the previous mentioned causes are the most important causes [3].

There are a lot of females that complain of different type of sexual dysfunction and do not have any obvious organic or psychiatric problems [4].

Our aim is to evaluate the impact of general life characteristics on sexual function in young women, that are apparently healthy and do not have any major cause for sexual function impairment.

## Material, Method

Study design: to select young females that fulfills the following criteria: 
- Inclusion criteria: female aged 20 to 30 years, in a stable relationship, for at least 12 months prior the investigation, not know major organic disorders: endocrine, ovarian, cardiovascular, gynecological, and not know depression or anxiety, no major disagreements in the current relationship.

- Exclusion criteria: menstrual cycle irregularities, negative obstetrical experience, know internal/surgical pathology, positive cancer history, puberty delay, and premature ovarian failure.

- Compliance criteria: willingness to complete de interview and also the FSFI questionnaire.

- Temporal criteria: recruitment period of 12 months: June 2012-June 2013.

The study group aimed healthy young women who were willing to complete the interview and the FSFI 
questionnaire. We identified 320 young females, with ages between 20 and 30 years; mean 26.5 ± 1.15 years that 10th International Conference on Mathematical Problems in Engineering, Aerospace and Sciences AIP Conf. Proc. 1637, 1377-1380 (2014); doi: 10.1063/1.4907303

## Mathematical Background **And Results**

The band-limited interpoland to  is the    !:

$$S_{h}(x)=\frac{\sin(\pi x/h)}{(2\pi/h)\tan(x/2)}$$  Note that since $\tan x/2\sim x/2$ as $x\to0$, $S_{h}(x)$ behaves like the nonperiodic _sine_ function  $$S_{h}(x)=\frac{\sin(\pi x/h)}{\pi x/h}$$  in the limit $x\to0$ - independently of $h$[5].  
An expansion of a periodic grid function  in the basis of shifted periodic delta functions takes the form 
An expansion of a periodic grid function $v$ in the basis of shifted periodic del  $$v_{j}=\sum\nolimits_{m=1}^{N}v_{m}\delta_{j-m}$$  in analogy to  $$v_{j}=\sum\nolimits_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}v_{m}\delta_{j-m}$$  Thus the band-limited interpolant of  $$p(x)=\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{k=-N/2}^{N/2}e^{ikx_{j}}\delta_{k}\,,j=1,...\,N$$  (where the terms $k=\pm N/2$ are multiplied by $\frac{1}{2}$), can be written in analogy to  $$p(x)=\sum\nolimits_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}v_{m}S_{h}(x-x_{m})$$  as  $$p(x)=\sum\limits_{m=1}^{N}v_{m}S_{N}(x-x_{m})$$  In the following, we will establish a connection between static and static

## Conclusions

We tried to find the impact of age and increased body weight on the sexual function in young premenopausal women. Both parameters have an independent influence on the FSFI score, as a quantitative marker for female sexual function. The higher the weight the lower the FSFI score, with a higher probability of lower values then the diagnostic threshold, the value of 23. The same relationship is valid also for age, even in this young females, increase in age will increase the risk of developing sexual dysfunction. Further analysis with more integrated parameter is needed for a better prediction of the risk of inappropriate sexual function in premenopausal women.
