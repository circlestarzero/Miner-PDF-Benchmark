Downloaded from http://journals.lww.com/greenjournal by BhDMf5ePHKbH4TTImqenVE43Jac9MNmRkbWTA8SD4h0k3hZSKk8NkrHEJtLCjpwj on 08/31/2018 In "Committee Opinion No. 738: Aromatase Inhibitors in Gynecologic Practice" from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,1 there is an error on page e196, second column, first paragraph. In the first full sentence, the phrase "letrozole was more effective than clomiphene citrate with a higher live birth rate (27.5% versus 10.1%. P5.007)" is incorrect and should instead read, "letrozole was more effective than clomiphene citrate with a higher live birth rate (27.5% versus 19.1%,
P5.007)." The full, corrected sentence is as follows: "However, in a more recent randomized controlled trial, letrozole was more effective than clomiphene citrate with a higher live birth rate (27.5% versus 19.1%, P5.007), and cumulative ovulation rate (61.7% versus 48.3%,
P,.001) (29)."
