�A. NEW DRAG SAWiNG JrlACHINE. 

The acc.ompanying engraving represents an impr.oved 'drag 
-sawing machine, the inventi.on .of Mr. William W. Giles, .of Chicago, IlL The first machine devised by this invent.or .on the same general principle was the subject .of an applicati.on f.or a patent in 1862. We are inf.ormed that the recently patented impr.ovements have rendered the,machine a marked success. It is s.o clearly sh.own in the engraving that but little explanati.on will be required The main frame .of the machine is about eight feet l.ong, and the fr.ont end rests up.on th,e l.og being sawed. A wedge is fastened with a hinge t.o the main frame, and when the l.og pinches the saw the wedge is turned .over and driven int.o the saw kerf. 

The Ileat· up.on which the 
.operat.or sits is capable .of sufficient m.oti.on t.o all.ow the machinery t.o w.ork. The 
.operat.or, by pressure .of the feet up.on the treadles, E, 
thr.ows the saw f.orward; this m.ovement is als.o supplemented by pulling the main lever, D, with the hands. By this means the saw is pr.opelled with great f.orce, as the m.ost .of the weight .of the b.ody and the strength .of the arms are empl.oyed in d.oing the w.ork. When the 
.operat.or pushes the lever, D, 
bef.ore him, he transfers his weight fr.om the treadles t.o the seat, and the latter will be pressed d.own; in fact, the 
.operat.or may put m.ore than his weight up.on the seat in this way, and when the p.ower is applied thus the saw is drawn backward. In using this machine the weight .of the .operat.or and the muscles .of his arms and legs are all br.ought int.o acti.on. The saw has a three-f.o.ot str.oke, and is capable .of d.oing c.onsiderable executi.on. 

The manufacture .of this machine is c.onducted at 741 W. Lake street, and the .office is at r.o.om 20, N.o. 149 Clark street, Chicag.o, TIL 
A NEW FmE ESCAPE. 

The fire escape ladder sh.own in the acc.ompanying engraving is the inventiDn .of Mr. J.oseph R. Winters, .of Ohambersburg, Pa. It is designedt.o be used b.oth as a fire escape and a supp.ort f.or fire h.ose. 

The main frame is m.ounted up.on wheels and supp.orts tw.o screws, E, and the lazyt.ongs, B. The screws, E, are pr.ovided with miter wheels, which are driven by miter wheels .on a shaft at the end 
.of the main frame. On the ends .of this shaft there are fly wheels, G, pr.ovided with cranks set diametrically .opp.o. 

site each .other. A bar piv.oted t.o tw.o .of the l.ower levers 
.of the lazyt.ongs carries nuts which travel .on the screws, E, as they are turned by the mechanism already described The .other pair .of the l.ower levers .of the lazyt.ongs rests up.on a supp.ort that is adjustable vertically by tw.o screws which are turned by the gearing seen belDw the main frame. This adjustment alters the level .of the base .of the ladder, and c.onsequently varies its inc}inati.on. 

H.ose, C, suitable f.or fire purp.oses, extends fr.om the fixed pipe, H, t.o the t.op .of the ladder, and is pr.ovided with n.ozzles. One .of the upper pairs .of arms is longer than the .other, and reaches 
.over to receive the pulley that supp.orts the r.ope fr.om the windlass, A. This r.ope carries a b.ox Dr basket, D, used f.or l.owering g.o.ods Dr pers.ons. 

The truck carrying the MISCELLANEOUS INVENTI.ONS. 

An impr.oved f.ountain brush has been patented by Mr. 

Martin J. SUnderlin, .of Watkins, N. Y. This apparatus is' designed f.or washing and cleansing h.orses, mules, and cattle, and articles such as wag.ons, carriages, etc., and als.o f.or washing and shamp.o.oing the human head and body. The invention p.onsists in a brush having c.om bined with it a sp.onge, and having a water distributing chamber, a flexible tube f.or supplying water, and a st.opc.ock f.or c.ontr.olling the supply, these parts being arranged s.o that the water is c.onducted t.o. the distributing chamber in the brush, and passes t.o the sponge, fr.omwhence it passes in a uniform and c.ontinu.ous supply t.o the .object t.o be cleansed. 

Mr. Benjamin F. Fuchs, .of Tiger Mill, Texas, has invented an impr.oved washing machine having several n.ovel features which cann.ot be described with.out an engraving. 

Mr. Benjamin B. Blewett, 
.of New Y.ork city, has invented an impr.oved picket stake f.or picketing Dr tethering horses and cattle. It can be readily entered int.o the gr.ound Dr rem.oved therefr.om . with.out requiring the use .of a mallet .or .other implement t.o drive it. It c.onsists in a picket stake having the pin that enters t.he gr.ound made as a blade, semicircular in cr.oss secti.on, and tapering lengthwise, and fitted at the base with a plate fDr driving the blade by pressure .of the 
.operat.or's f.o.ot, and the handle f.or h.olding the stake while it is being driven. The r.ope is attached t.o the handle, and the handle fitted t.o rev.olve t.o prevent winding. 

An impr.ovement in .oil press plates has been patented by Mr Ge.orge W. Campbell, .of West New Bright.on, N. Y. 

The .object .of this inventi.on is t.o prevent the rapid destruclazyt.ongs is provided with spring-bearing pieces, F, which check the d.own ward m.oti.on .of the ladder and assist in starting it upward. 

This fire escape, as will be seen, is capable .of being raised t.o any height within the limits .of the capacity .of the rna· chine, and it may be inclined at different angles t.o bring it int.o p.ositi.on f.or use under varying c.onditi.ons.

GILES' DRAG SA WING MACHINE. 

The windlass and tbe basket, D, aff.ord a means .of escape f.or invalids and children, and the ladder itself aff.ords ample means .of escape t.o such as are able-b.odied, while at the same time it is c.onvenient and efficient as a fireman's ladder. This invention is patented in this c.ountry and in Eur.ope. The New Y.ork .office is in the C.oal and Iron Exchange BuildinBj. 

ti.on .of the bag Dr wrapper that c.ontains the gr.ound seed while being pressed, and t.o avoid the use .of the .ordinary mats, s.o as t.o lessen the expense. The inventi.on c.onsists in pr.oviding the .ordinary c.orrugated .oil press plates with pr.ojecti.ons and indenta ti.ons Dr sh.ort gr.o.oves. 

An impr.ovement in bridge walls f.or furnaces has been patented by Mr. J.ohn Mailer, 
.of Pachec.o, Cal. The invent.or places a m.ovable 'bridge wall in a b.oiler furnace t.o c.ontract the area .of .outlet fr.om the fire surface t.o the b.oiler flues Mr Henry M.orris.on, .of Pittsburg, Pa. , has patented an impr.oved device f.or h.olding ribb.on-gold while teeth are being filled, t.o facilitate the .operati.on, lessen the time reqUIred, the lab.or .of the 
.operat.or, and the exhausti.on 
.of the patient. It c.onsists in

An open-work partition· for cattle stalls, formed of bars crossing each other·diagonaIly, has been patented by Mr . 

Joseph B. Greenhut, of Chicago, Ill. By means of these partitions the cattle are kept in their places withollt chaining or tying, and yet ventilation is not perceptibly obstructed, nor is admission of light from the ends of the stable materially hindered. The expense of constructing the partitions ill also small as compared with the usual Close or tight board partitiois. 

An improvement in· plows.has been ·patented by Mr. FernilDdo Gautier, of West Pascagoula, Miss. The invention cousists in combining with tije plow an oscillating knife oppurposes, which presents in a single device and compact form, the functions of a hammer, screw driver, corkscrew, 
<ian opener, ice pick, glass cutter ano. breaker, stove lifter, tack drawer, Raw set, knife sharpener, wrench, steak tenderer, and putty knife.

NEW CALCULATING ATTACHMENT FOR WEIGHING 

SCALES. 

The improved attachment for weighing scales shown in the accompanying 'engraving was recently patented by Henry H. Ham, Jr., of Portsmouth, N. H. The object of the mventlOn 18 to itldicate the price of any number of pounds or ounces of the article being weighed. 

The scales are of the usual construction, .and to the base is attached a cylIndrical case, slotted along the top, and contammg a cylInder upon which are placed a number of rows of figures arranged m anthmetical progreSSIOn, each row representing the price per pound or ounce of some particular article. The numbered cylInder may c(Jntain any desired number of rows of figures, and the row representing any particular class of goods may be brought opposite the slot in the casing. 

Tbe slidmg weigbt on the scale beam is provided with an index which pOints to one of tbe numbers on the cylindrical scale. This number represents the price of tbe total quantity of tbe substance on tbe scale. It will be seen that this device avoids all calculating and insures accuracy.

NATURAL HISTORY NOTES. 

Relation8 of Flower8 and Insect8.-For some years past-' 
since the publication of Darwin's researches-we have been accust01lled to look on the forms, colors, perfumes, and nectar-like secretions of flowers as so many adaptations and contrivances to secure the visits of insects, and the consequent fertilization of the flower. Recently, however, an observer ha'sbeeu found who is bold enough to cballenge these opinions of Darwin, Delpino, Mueller, Lubbock, and o.thers. M. Gaston Bonnier, after having observed during the last seven years some 800 plants in various parts of Europe, comes to the following conclusions, the details upon which he founds them being given in recent numbers of tbe Annales de8 Science8 
. NatureUe8 and of the BuUetin of the Botanical 'Society of France: 
." 1. Tbe development of colors in flowers bas no relation to tbe development of nectar. In closely allied species of the same genus, tbe most conspicuous flowers are not those whicb are most visited by insects; 
" 2. In dioocious flowers provided with nectar tbe insects do not visit first the mille and afterwards tbe female flower. 

. "6. ·Bees become accustomed to colors, but as mucb so to those whicb are inconspicuous as to tbose which are brilliant. 

:Forthe same weigbt of boney a green sur
. face is as freely visited as a green surface with a background of red. 

"4. The development of spots and stripes on tbe corolla bas no relation to tbe production of nectar." 
Not long smee notice was taken in tbis paper of the strong digestive power of the jUice of the pawpaw, Garica papaya, used in Brazil for giving tenderness to fresh meat. Dr. Bouchut, of Paris, has been experimenting with this remarkable vegetable product, and finds that it dissolves the false membranes which form in the throat of patients suffering from croup. It IS also found to kill and dis- CALCULATING ATTACHMENT FOR WEIGHING SCALES.

out tbat tbese accumulations of saccharine material occur usually in parts of tbe plant wbere development is going on actively, as in young leaves or young ovaries. Wben tbe emission of liquid ceases, the saccharine matters contained in tbe nectaries return into tbe plant, and are probably used up by tbe neigbboring parts in tbe course of this development. In fact, tbe nectaries, whether floral or extra-floral, wbether tbey excrete liquid or not, act as reservoirs of nutriment which is in direct relation to tbe life of the plant. 

Vegetable " Gommen8ali8m."..:.....1 wonder, says Mr. J. E. 

Taylor. wbetber botanists will ultimately discover that certain plants are" commensal," as well as certain animals, such as Prof. Van Beneden blls told us about in his" Animal Messmates. " For several years past, I bave been. particularly struck by tbe occurrence in tbe eastern counties (of England) of tbe yellow wort (Ghlora perfoliata) so constantly in company witb the bee orchis (Ophry8 a pifera), that wben I bave found one pl�nt I have almost instinctively looked for tbe otber. Has this association been noted elsewbere? It seems possible to imagine tbat flowers generally obscure sbould reap some advantage by growing in the neighborhood of more attractive kinds 
(althougb the bright yellow wort bardly needs to associate with tbe bee orcbis on tbat account), just as you see little confectioners' bootbs springing up by tbe side of the itinerant circus, in order to profit by the greater attraction of the noisy exhibition. Again, I conceive it possible that otber flowers may be advantaged in quite a different way, by growing in company with plants possessing some poisonous, stinging, or other defensive property. Thus, it is noticeable bow certain kinds of umbelliferous flowers are always found growing in the midst of dense patches of nettles, or amid the thorny brambles and bedge rows. 

Have any of our botanical readers noticed anything approacbing such 
" commensalism" as bere suggested? 

Multiplication of Weed8.-It bas been found, says tbe American Agriculturist, by careful and patient counting of tbe number of perfect seeds produced in a number of seed pods, and then counting tbe number of mature pods, tbat on a Bingle plant of purslane (Portulaca oleracea) tbere will be 1,000,000 seeds matured. . Tbis will furnish a seed for every square foot of ground on 23 acres. Suppose each of these plants of tbe second generation does as well as the single parent, we will bave tbe enormous sum of 1,000,000,000,000, Tbis animal is found in Soutb Africa and in parts of East Africa, generally upon the busby highlands near the rivers. 

It is about three feet in lengtb from tbe tip of the nose to tbe end of tbe tail, the tail being about one-third of the entire lengtb. The ears are enormous, entirely disproportionate to tbe rest of the animal. Tbe eyes are sharp, the nose pointed, the legs are of good length. It sleeps during tbe day and goes out for its prey in tbe nigbt. It lives on small animals and upon grassboppers. Tbe natives hunt it down for its fur and even eat its flesh, althougb it bas It very offensive taste. 

A Horse Crazed with Tea. 

Lord William Beresford, in addition to bis distinction as a gallant and cbivalrous soldier, will I.e distinguisbed in history as tbe owner of a horse wbi.ch was poisoned by tea. The Veterinary Journal reports the "case," and characterizes it as ,. unparalleled in the annals of veterinary or even buman toxicology." A staff cook having left some pounds of tea in a sack, a Kallir groom filled it with corn, and serving out tbe contents to a troop of horses, gave Lord William Beresford's cbarger tbe bulk of tbe tea, whicb was eaten greedily, and produced the most startling results. 

The animal· plunged and kicked, and ran backwards, at intervals galloping madly around, finally falling into a donga, wbere it lay dasbing its head on the rocks, and was dispatched by an assegai tbrust througb the heart. The po8t-mortlJln appearances indicated extreme cere· 
bral congestion. 'The occurrence as an accident is probably unique. 

The pbenomena exhibited were, bowever, cbaracteristic of the action of caffeine-namely, cerebral excitement, with partial loss of sensibili· 
ty, convulsions; and deatb. The sensory nerves are paralyzed witbout any corresponding paralysis of the motor nerves, so tbat the muscular action, wbicb proceeds from ideation and volition, remains un-affected. The reversal of limb movements, wbich produce running backwards in quadrupeds, is a common symptom of brain disturbance, frequently witnessed, for example, in the case of puppies witb unclosed crania. Tbe case is one of gre!!ot jnttlrest, I!-�d may help to throw light on the action of era ted by means of an eccentric. Tbe advantage of an oscillating knife over a rotary one is, that when plowing very deep or turning under coarse material it, is not so liable to come into contact with tbe ground. 

An improved macbine or apparatus· to be mounted on a pl(Jw beani for sowing and distributing seeds and fertilizers bas been patented by Mr. WilliamG. Humpbreys, of Pendleton, S. C. Any two kinds of see.ds, such as corn and beans or pease, wbich are often sown together, can witb this machine be sown at the same time. Corn and guano, cotton seed and mineral phosphate, or any seed and fertilizer can be sown witb accuracy at one and tbe same time, or in quick alternation, by this apparatus, tbe plowsbare marking tbe farrow in advance of tbe sowing. 

An improvement in barvesters hilS been patented by Mr. 

Alonzo N. Wilson, of Coon Rapids, Iowa. Tbis is an improvement in barvesters wbose platforms are made vertically adjustable at eacb end ibdependently of the trucks to which mem-
THE OTOCYON.-(Otocyon Gaffer.) 
they are hinged. It consists in a peculiar arrangement of parts for raising and lowering tbe platform without' changing its horizontal angle. 

Mr. Samuel L. Waters, of Genoa, III. , has patented an improved barrow· for loosening, pulverizing, and smoothing
