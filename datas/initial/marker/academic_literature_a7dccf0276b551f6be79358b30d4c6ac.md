Delineation of trembling aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) clones in a 40-year-old aspen stand at Riding Mountain National Park (RMNP) and a 25- to 50-year-old aspen stand at Agassiz Forest Reserve (AFR), Manitoba, has shown that at RMNP clone size averages 0.20 acre (0.08 ha) and at AFR 0.015 acre (0.006 ha). Largest clone mapped at RMNP was 3.80 acres (1.54 ha) and at AFR 1.24 acres (0.5 ha). Although soils are heavier and the amount of ground vegetation is greater at RMNP,
the clone size of the respective areas appears unrelated to present site factors.

Interclonal variation in growth characteristics makes necessary the sampling of several clones when undertaking inventory and site productivity studies. In stands such as in RMNP where relatively large clones are found it is recommended that either transect plots or a larger than normal number of conventional plots are used to ensure that the required number of clones is sampled. In stands similar to those at AFR where clone size is small no special sampling modifications are required.

L'auteur a mesure la superficie de clones de Trembles ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) dans des peuplements purs dont I'un était âgé de 40 ans dans le parc national de Riding Mountain (PNR M) at I'autre âgé de 25 à 50 ans dans la réserve forestière d'Agassiz (RFA) au Manitoba. Au PNRM la superficie moyenne des clones faisait 0.20 acre (le plus grand : 3.80 acre), et a la RFA, elle mesurait 0.015 acre (le plus grand :
1.24 acre). Le sol aux deux endroits est formé de till calcaire, bien qu'au PNRM il soil généralement plus lourd et plus humide qu'a la RFA. De plus, la vegetation terrestre et la matiere organique sont plus abondantes au PNRM.

Il n'y a pas de corrélation des caractères de la station et de la grandeur des clones entre ces deux lieux.

L'auteur recommande certaines techniques spéciales lors de l'échantillonnage durant l'inventaire et lors des études sur la productivité des stations.

## Introduction

The occurrence of clones in natural trembling aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) stands has been well documented (Sandberg 1951; Maini 1960; Strain 1964; Blake 1964; Barnes 1966). Phenotypic variation among clones has been shown in many traits such as stem form (Van Buijtenen et al. 1962), phenology of leaf flushing and leaf fall (Maini 1960), growth rate (Garrett and Zahner 1964; Zahner and Crawford 1965), suckering ability
(Maini 1967), wood properties (Einspahr et 1967), leaf morphology (Barnes 1969),
al.

and resistance to decay (Wall 1971). The importance of clones and their size on stand development, site quality assessment, and cull determination has been pointed out by others
(Barnes 1966; Zahner and Crawford 1965; Wall 1971). The purposes of this study were:
(1) to determine the size of trembling aspen Can. J. For. Res., 3 , 472 (1973)
clones in two areas in Manitoba and if possible relate this to site characteristics, and (2) to point out the problem of getting accurate inventory data when aspen clones are of relatively large size.

## Study Areas

One study area was selected at Riding Mountain National Park (RMNP), in the eastern extremity of B18a Mixedwood Section (Rowe 1972) (Fig. 1).

Another area was selected at Agassiz Forest Reserve
(AFR) in the B15 Manitoba Lowland Section.

Riding Mountain National Park The area supports a dense young trembling aspen stand with varying mixtures of balsam poplar ( Populus balsamifera L.) and only sporadic individuals of white spruce ( Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). The present stand of aspen is about 40 years old with an average stocking of 1100 trees/acre (2700 trees/ha).

Dominant tree height averages 47 ft (14 m). Average tree diameter at breast height is 4.5 in. (11.4 cm)
472

and basal area of the stand per acre averages about 110 ft 2 (25 m 2 per ha).

Soils are formed on morainic deposits overlying soft bedrock shales. They are heavy clay-loam tills of a calcareous nature belonging to the Gray Luvisol Group (Canada Department of Agriculture 1970).

The organic and Ah horizons are rich in nutrients and support a luxuriant growth of shrubs, herbs, and grasses. Moisture regimes, as defined by Hills (1952),
range from moderately moist to moist.

Ground vegetation is generally dense. The shrub layer, comprising vegetation up to 6 ft (1.8 m),
principally of Corylus cornuta Marsh. and Prunus virginiana L., provides an almost 100% cover, although locally it may be light. Lesser vegetation, up to 1 ft (0.3 m), is luxuriant and forms a complete ground cover.

Agassiz Forest Reserve The area supports an uneven-aged trembling aspen stand associated with some jack pine ( Pinus banksiana Lamb.), white birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), and balsam poplar. The aspen is 25-50 years old, al­
though in places pockets of younger trees are found.

The number of aspen per acre varies considerably due to irregular stocking and age. Tree diameter at breast height averages 4.5 in. (11.4 cm), and dominant height averages 45 ft (14 m).

The area is part of the Lake Agassiz basin. Soils have been formed on clay-loam glacial tills. However, due to local glacio-fluvial outwashes, lacustrine sediments, and wave action of water from Lake Agassiz, soils vary in nutrient level and drainage condition. The soils can be described as Gray Luvisols.

Drainage varies from excessive to normal. The moisture regime, as defined by Hills (1952) varies from dry to fresh.

Density of ground vegetation varies considerably, due to the varying soil nutrient levels and range in drainage conditions. Shrub vegetation (up to 6 ft (1.8 m) in height), principally of Rosa acicularis Lindl.,
Prunus virginiana, and Corylus cornuta occasionally forms a complete cover but is generally absent or sparse. Density of lesser vegetation (up to 1 ft (0.3 m) in height) is less variable and although not luxuriant is generally present throughout.

The two areas differ substantially in site conditions.

Although the soils of both areas are formed on calcareous till, the texture of soils at RMNP is mainly a clay loam, whereas at AFR the texture may vary from medium sand to gravel with occasional clay layers due to post-glacial water action. Organic layers at RMNP are up to 5 in. (12.7 cm) thick, but are only about 2 in. (5.0 cm) thick at AFR. The more molst and fertile soil conditions at RMNP compared to AFR give rise to more luxuriant ground vegetation and better height growth of the aspen.

## Methods

On each study area 10 0.1-acre (0.04-ha) sample plots were located at random and all trees on each plot were identified by clone, using the method described by Barnes (1959, 1969). Morphological characteristics of early leaves (Critchfield 1960) were used primarily in the identification of clones, although at times use was made of bark features, stem form, and the phenology of leaf flushing and leaf fall.

Where clones could be identified with relative ease
(e.g. from bark characteristics or stem form) and

![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)

![2_image_0.png](2_image_0.png)

established by joining together the ramets at the edge of the clone. Within each clone boundary the number of trees belonging to that clone as a percentage of the total number of trees within the boundary, was used to obtain an estimate of clone intermixing.

## Results

Riding Mountain National Park Within the 10 0.1-acre (0.04-ha) plots a total of 54 trembling aspen clones were identified. Average size of identified clones was 0.20 acre (0.08 ha). However, size of individual clones ranged from less than 0.01 acre (0.004 ha), with the clone consisting of two or three individuals, to a maximum of more than 1 acre
(0.4 ha) (Table 1). The two largest clones identified were 1.15 (0.46 ha) and 3.80 acres
(1.5 ha) in size. In addition to the clones of known size the boundaries of 19 clones were difficult to determine. Although these clones could have been somewhat larger than their 474 indicated minimum size (Table 1), their actual size probably did not differ by more than 0.1 acre (0.04 ha). Of the total number of clones 15 (= 28%) were smaller than 0.01 acre
(0.004 ha), 19 (= 35%) had a size between 0.01 (0.004) and 0.10 acre (0.04 ha), and 19

![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)

(=35%) were larger than 0.10 acre (0.04

![3_image_1.png](3_image_1.png) ha). The size of one clone could not be determined.

Relatively few clones accounted for most of the trees on any of the plots. For instance, on

![3_image_2.png](3_image_2.png) any given plot the largest three clones accounted for 75-100% of the total number of trees on the plot.

A map of one of the plots was selected to show position and clone designation of individual trees and the boundary of some clones
(Figs. 2A and B). Intermixing of ramets of different clones was evident on all plots. In one extreme case two groups of ramets belonging to the same clone were found to be separated by about 200 ft (60 m).

## Agassiz Forest Reserve

A total of 226 clones were identified on the 10 0.1-acre (0.04 ha) plots at AFR. The number of clones on nine plots ranged from 16 to 39. On one plot only two clones were found.

Average clone size, based on all identified clones, was 0.015 acre (0.006 ha). Of the 226 clones, 205 (91%) were less than 0.01 acre
(0.004 ha) in size (Table 2). Fourteen clones (6%) fell into the 0.01-0.10 acre (0.0040.04 ha) class and only three clones (1.5%) exceeded 0.1 acre (0.04 ha). The largest clone

![3_image_3.png](3_image_3.png) occupied 1.24 acres (0.50 ha). Of four clones
(1.5%) no estimate of clone size could be obtained.

![3_image_4.png](3_image_4.png)

Some ' clones ' are represented by only one tree. To determine whether these trees are in fact suckers rather than seedlings, the base of a number of these trees was excavated. It was established that of those excavated, 70% were definitely of sucker origin and the remaining 30% were probably of sucker origin.

In contrast to the RMNP area, clone size on plots in the AFR area was generally much smaller and there was a greater variation in the number of clones between plots. The largest three clones accounted for 23-100% of the total number of trees on any given plot.

In general, the ramets of individual clones were grouped closely together (Fig. 3). How¬
STENEKER: SIZE OF ASPEN CLONES
ever, ramets of a few clones (e.g. clone 0-0)
were a considerable distance apart.

Clone Size and Site The two locations showed distinct site differences; and mean clone size of the areas differed significantly (p < 0.01). However, no meaningful relationship between clone size and site conditions could be deduced. Although the plots within each area showed differences in moisture conditions and apparent nutrient status, no within-arca relationship was apparent between clone size and soil moisture and nutrient level.

Only two plots at AFR supported clones of a size comparable to the larger clones at RMNP (Table 2). Sizes were 1.24 (0.50) 0.52 (0.21), and 0.30 acres (0.12 ha). A vegetation analysis indicated an above-average amount of shrub vegetation for the area on the two plots, made up principally of Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt. on one plot and Corylus cornuta on the other. The thickness of the litter-, fermentation-, and humus-layers on the two plots also tended to be slightly more than the average of 2 in. (5.0 cm) for all plots in the AFR area.

## Discussion

Clone size for the Riding Mountain area averaged 0.20 acre (0.08 ha). This average is larger than the 0.07-acre (0.03-ha) average observed by Bertenshaw (1965) and Barnes
(1969) in aspen stands in northern Lower Michigan, but corresponds with observations by Wall (personal communication, 1969) in the Duck Mountain Forest Reserve in western Manitoba.

Intermixing of ramets of clones in the two areas was quite common, and this is not unexpected. Excavations at RMNP have shown roots of different clones to intermix freely.

Thus, after stand disturbance, suckers from different clones are likely to be closely intermingled.

No relationship could be established between site and clone size. However, it is quite possible that observed differences in clone size between and within study areas are the result of stand history rather than site per se. Bertenshaw (1965) concluded that clone size is probably more influenced by the pattern of initial seedling establishment and disturbance history than

by site. According to Barnes (1966), clone size appears to be inversely proportional to the number of seedlings established. At one time site conditions at AFR may have been more favorable for seedling establishment than as RMNP, thereby providing opportunities for more clones to become established at AFR.

Findings presented have direct bearing on sampling techniques for inventory and site productivity studies in trembling aspen stands.

Sampling intensity will be dependent on the variation in characteristics under study. Where such variation is small, only a few clones need to be sampled. Clone size will determine which sampling technique will ensure that the required number of clones are taken. In stands such as found in the RMNP area where clones may cover up to several acres, it is advisable to use a transect plot which is several hundred feet long and fairly narrow (e.g. 20 ft (6 m)
wide). This will ensure the sampling of a number of clones rather than one or two as might be the case when using conventional plots or variable plot sampling with a relascope. An alternative would be to establish as many conventional sample plots or relascope readings as the number of clones to be sampled. These plots or readings should be several hundred feet apart to ensure that they contain different clones.

In stands like those found in the AFR area where clone size is relatively small, no special effort needs to be made to sample the required number of clones. Any conventional plot or relascope reading will contain a sufficient number of clones to account for interclonal variation.

To obtain some idea of clone size in a stand it is advisable to view the stand in the spring or autumn during either leaf flushing or leaf fall. The observed phenological differences between clones should give some indication of clone size and sampling method to use.
