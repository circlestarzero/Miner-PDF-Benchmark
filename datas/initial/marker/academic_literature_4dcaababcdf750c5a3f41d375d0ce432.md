Abstract—A new method is proposed for controlling the composition (nonstoichiometry) of low-volatile inorganic compounds. The basic principle of the method is the introduction (or removal) of one of the components into the low-volatile compound using reversible selective chemical vapor transport (CVT). Theoretical analysis is used to identify the process parameters determining the direction of mass transport: source temperature T1, source composition x1, and sample temperature T2. Using nonequilibrium thermodynamics concepts, steadystate conditions are found under which mass transport ceases. A new type of phase diagram, x2–T1–T2, is proposed, which describes the state of CVT systems under steady-state conditions without mass transport. The CVT process is used to prepare GaSe crystals with different deviations from stoichiometry. The crystals are characterized using x-ray diffraction and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. The stability regions of two GaSe polytypes in the T–x phase diagram are located. CVT is used to control the compositions of phases in the In–S
system. The advantages of the CVT method are analyzed with application to control over the composition of inorganic compounds.

## 1. Introduction

The ability to control the composition of inorganic compounds within their homogeneity ranges is a critical issue in inorganic chemistry. If one of the components of a binary phase has a significant vapor pressure
(on the order of 102 to 103 Pa or higher), its composition can be varied by two-zone annealing with a feed charge [1]. The crystal composition is then governed by the vapor pressure of the volatile component, which, in turn, depends on the charge composition and temperature. In the case of practically nonvolatile compounds, two-zone annealing is, however, essentially impossible.

In this work, we describe a new approach to compositional control. The basic principle of this approach is the introduction (or removal) of a component into a low-volatile crystal using reversible selective chemical vapor transport (CVT). We present theoretical analysis of the new method and experimental data demonstrating that it can be used to control the stoichiometry of solid inorganic compounds.

The method has a number of features in common with classical annealing in vapor of the volatile component and CVT. The principal dissimilarity from conventional CVT is that the sample composition varies during the process, but without resublimation. In contrast to conventional annealing, the system contains an additional substance capable of transporting one of the components of the low-volatile phase from the sample to the charge or in the opposite direction. In conventional CVT [2–13], the composition of the growing crystal is influenced by many factors: the nature of the transporting agent, the source and product temperatures, the temperature profile in the reactor, the initial sample composition, the reactor shape, and microimpurities in the vapor phase and reactor material. In connection with this, the use of chemical transport for tuning the composition of inorganic compounds is a challenging problem. Given the marked difference between the proposed and earlier approaches to compositional control, particular attention should be paid to thermodynamic analysis of the processes involved in nondestructive vapor-transport (NVT) annealing. The transport direction and the final, steady state of the (generally) nonisothermal system must then be identified in a more complex manner compared to the known twozone annealing processes.

## 2. Thermodynamic Analysis

The NVT method is generally based on a reversible selective reaction of component A of a low-volatile sample with a transporting substance ArCq (r ≥ 0, q ≥ 1)
present in the vapor phase:

$$(n q-m r)\mathrm{A}^{\mathrm{cond}}+m\mathrm{A}_{r}\mathrm{C}_{q}^{\mathrm{v}}\,=\,q\mathrm{A}_{n}\mathrm{C}_{m}^{\mathrm{v}}.$$
$$(1)$$

Here, the indices cond and v refer to the condensed and vapor phases, respectively, and r, q, and n are the stoichiometric coefficients. In what follows, our consideration will be restricted to the use of NVT for controlling

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)

the composition of binary condensed phases, e.g., compounds with the general formula AxBy, where A and B,
as well as A and C in Eq. (1), are independent components.

Nondestructive compositional control with the use of selective CVT is exerted in a closed system. An AxBy sample is placed at one end of an ampule, and a source or getter of the component to be transported (A) is placed at the other end (Fig. 1). In addition, the system contains a third component, e.g., in the form of a volatile substance ArCq (a compound of component A with the transporting agent C). The amount of this substance is such that, at the process temperature, the system is filled with vapors of compounds of the transporting agent (ArCq + AnCm) at a total pressure of 103–105 Pa 14].

Thus, NVT can be thought of as annealing in an atmosphere containing the transporting agent C or its compounds (ArCq and AnCm) in the presence of a source (getter) of the component to be transported (A) [14–17].

The NVT method can be applied if the following conditions are fulfilled:
1. There are comparable amounts of the vapor species ArCq and AnCm in the partial equilibrium (1) for the transport of component A from the sample to the source (getter) and in the opposite direction.

2. Under experimental conditions, there are no binary or ternary compounds of the transporting agent C with the second component (which is not transported) of the sample and source (getter) (nonreactivity of the third component with the second one).

3. The solubility of C in the compound AxBy is insignificant.

4. The AxBy sample and the source (getter) remain nonvolatile under experimental conditions.

The main model systems in this work are Group IIIA chalcogenides.

As shown earlier [14], iodide vapor transport can be used to control the composition of low-volatile gallium selenides (GaSe and Ga2Se3) at temperatures from 800 to 1000 K and pressures from 3 × 104 to 3 × 105 Pa, that is, under conditions where condensed ternary compounds (e.g., GaSeI [18]) are nonexistent [19, 20]. The gallium source (getter) used was pure gallium metal, and the transporting agent was gallium triiodide, GaI3.

This ensured chemical transport due to the selective, reversible reaction

$$2\mathrm{Ga}^{\mathrm{cond}}+\mathrm{Gal}_{3}^{\mathrm{v}}\,=\,3\mathrm{Gal}^{\mathrm{v}}.$$
$$\left(2\right)$$

The experimental data reported in [14] indicate that the transport continues until a steady state is reached, in which the flux JGa is zero, and both the sample and getter are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the vapor phase, as represented by

$$k_{p}(T_{1},x_{1})\,=\,k_{p}(T_{2},x_{2}),$$
$$(3)$$

where kp is the quantity which is usually (and not quite adequately, as will be shown below) called the heterogeneous equilibrium constant, T1 and T2 are the source
(getter) and sample temperatures, and x1 and x2 are the source (getter) and sample compositions, respectively.

For equilibrium (2), kp is given by

$$k_{p}\,=\,{\frac{P_{\mathrm{Gal}}^{3}}{P_{\mathrm{Gal}_{3}}}}.\,$$

The convenience of using kp is that this quantity is related to the chemical potentials of the components of the condensed phase in equilibrium with the vapor phase [Eq. (2)].

Since the chemical potential of a component of a mixture of ideal gases can be represented in the form

$$\mu_{i}\,=\,\mu_{i}^{0}(T)+R T\mathrm{ln}\,p_{i},$$
$$({\mathfrak{H}})$$

from the necessary condition for equilibrium (2)

$$2\mu_{\mathrm{Ga}}^{\mathrm{cond}}\;=\;\mu_{\mathrm{Gal_{3}}}^{\mathrm{v}}-3\mu_{\mathrm{Gal}}^{\mathrm{v}}$$
$$(6)$$

we obtain

$$R T\mathrm{ln}k_{p}(p,T,x)\,=\,2\mu_{\mathrm{Ga}}^{\mathrm{cond}}(p,T,x)-F(T).\,^{1}$$
$$\left(7\right)$$

µi 0 Here, is the chemical potential of pure component i at standard pressure, pi is the partial pressure of component i, and the term depends on temperature only.

The empirical relation (3) enables one to solve the inverse problem: to determine the compositions of the sample and getter coexisting in a nonisothermal system at temperatures T1 and T2, which offers the possibility of controlling the composition of gallium selenides via NVT.

In previous studies, the factors determining the transport direction and the processes leading to a steady state, with no mass transport, have not been analyzed in sufficient detail. The purpose of this section is to establish the conditions under which a steady state can exist and to identify the processes leading to a steady state in a nonisothermal system involving heterogeneous selective transport reactions.

The system under consideration comprises a vapor phase with a continuous temperature field (determined by an external heat source) and solid phases situated in zones differing in temperature (Fig. 1). Solid phases in contact with a vapor phase in which chemical transport occurs are commonly thought of as discontinuous, heterogeneous systems. A vapor phase with a given temperature field is a classic example of a continuous system [21, 22]. The vapor transport in the system under consideration is however associated with heterogeneous chemical reactions. The interplay between the continuous system and condensed phases is represented by mass balance equations taking into account the substances involved in both the mass transport and chemical reactions. For this reason, the same parameters of the system in a nonequilibrium steady state (temperature profile along the length of the ampoule) determine both the partial pressures of vapor species and the conditions of partial equilibria in heterogeneous chemical reactions (and, accordingly, the compositions of solid phases). In light of this, in describing a steady state, one should use a single formalism applicable to vaporphase processes and heterogeneous chemical reactions.

As a rough approximation, we take that the dimensions of the solid phase are small compared to the elementary volume within which a local equilibrium exists. Within the elementary volume, intensive parameters are constant, and the local entropy S is the same function of local macroscopic variables as in the equilibrium system [21]. The elementary volume must be small compared to the total volume of the system and is determined by the temperature gradient. In the system under consideration, the temperature profile was such that the temperature variation over 1 cm (sample dimensions)
was negligible. The total length of the system was varied from 10 to 40 cm. Therefore, we can take as a first approximation that the solid phases were located within an elementary volume with constant intensive parameters of state.

$$F(T)\,=\,3\mu_{\mathrm{Gal}}^{\mathrm{v}^{0}}-\mu_{\mathrm{Gal}_{3}}^{\mathrm{v}^{0}}$$
$$({\boldsymbol{8}})$$

In this approach, the entropy production in an elementary volume as a result of a heterogeneous chemical reaction is given by [22]

S˙ 1T = ---Av. (9)
Here, A is the chemical affinity,

$$A\,=\,-\sum_{i}v_{i}\mu_{i},$$
$$(10)$$

and v is the reaction rate (mol/s),

$$v\;=\;\dot{n}_{i}/v_{i},$$
$$(11)$$

where is the time derivative of the amount of substance and vi is the corresponding stoichiometric coefficient (i = Ga, GaI, or GaI3). Multiplying the entropy production in a chemical reaction within an elementary volume by δ(ζ - z), where ζ is the coordinate specifying the position of the solid phase, we find the entropy production per unit volume in a three-dimensional system
(in our case, per unit length, since the temperature field is one-dimensional),
n˙i

$$\dot{s}_{1}=\frac{1}{T}A\,v\delta(\zeta_{1}-z),\quad\dot{s}_{2}=\frac{1}{T}A\,v\delta(\zeta_{2}-z),\quad(12)$$

where δ(ζγ - z) (γ = 1, 2) is the "shifted" Dirac function and

$$s(z)\,=\,\operatorname*{lim}_{V\,\rightarrow\,P(z)}\frac{S(V)}{V}$$
$$(13)$$

is the entropy density at point P(z). Note that the Dirac delta has dimensions of inverse volume if ζ comprises three spatial coordinates. If ζ is the coordinate in a onedimensional temperature field, δ(ζ - z) has dimensions of inverse length.

In describing irreversible processes, use is often made of the dissipative function, ϕ = T , which has dimensions of power. However, in the case under consideration, the transition from the expression for local entropy production to that for a local dissipative function is impeded by the fact that the T in Eq. (12) is a function of a spatial coordinate. For this reason, following Prigogine [21] we rely on the expression for local entropy production in subsequent analysis.

The partial Ga, Se, and Ga2Se pressures over solid gallium selenides are many orders of magnitude lower than the vapor pressures of gallium iodides, and their contributions to the total vapor pressure can be neglected. The vapor phase can then be regarded as two-component (GaI + GaI3). Since the entire system is assumed to be in mechanical equilibrium (∇p = 0), the s˙
irreversible processes in the continuous system are diffusion and heat transport. According to Haase [22], the local entropy production in such a system is given by s˙3 After necessary transformations, we obtain

$$\dot{s}_{3}\,=\,{\bf J}_{Q}\nabla\!\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)\!-\frac{1}{T}\frac{{\bf J}_{\rm Gal}}{(1-x_{\rm Gal})}(\nabla\!\mu_{\rm Gal})_{T}.\tag{22}$$
$${\dot{s}}_{3}\,=\,{\bf J}_{U}\nabla\!\left({\frac{1}{T}}\right)\,-\,\sum_{k\,=\,\mathrm{Gal,\,Gal}_{3}}{\bf J}_{k}\nabla\!\left({\frac{\mu_{k}}{T}}\right)\!,$$
$$(14)$$

where JU is the energy flux and Jk is the diffusion flux of species k. This equation can easily be transformed to

$${\dot{s}}_{3}\,=\,\biggl({\bf J}_{U}-\sum_{k}{\bf J}_{k}\mu_{k}\biggr)\nabla\biggl(\frac{1}{T}\biggr)-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k}{\bf J}_{k}\nabla\mu_{k}.$$
$$(15)$$

The thermodynamic driving forces determining the energy and mass transport in the system are, however, not separated in Eqs. (14) and (15). Given that the chemical potential is a function of µk(T, pk), we have

$$\nabla\mu_{k}\,=\,\frac{\partial\mu_{k}}{\partial T}\nabla T+(\nabla\mu_{k})_{T},$$
$$(16)$$

where (∇µk)T is the potential gradient due to the variation in vapor composition. The generalized forces can then be separated using the concept of reduced thermal flux [21],

$$\mathbf{J}_{Q}\,=\,\mathbf{J}_{U}-\sum_{k}\mathbf{J}_{k}H_{k},$$
$$(17)$$

where Hk is the partial molar enthalpy of species k.

Equation (15) then takes the form

$$\dot{s}_{3}\,=\,{\bf J}_{Q}\nabla\!\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)\!-\frac{1}{T}\!\sum_{k}{\bf J}_{k}(\nabla\!\mu_{k})_{T}.$$

To go from Eq. (18) to independent scalar fields, we use the Gibbs–Duhem equation

$$C_{\mathrm{Gal}}(\nabla\mu_{\mathrm{Gal}})_{T}+C_{\mathrm{Gal}_{3}}(\nabla\mu_{\mathrm{Gal}_{3}})_{T}\,=\,0,$$
$$(19)$$

where Ci is the density (local concentration) of species i, in conjunction with the condition that the volume flux must be zero at ∇p = 0,

$$\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{Gal}}V_{\mathrm{Gal}}+\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{Gal}_{3}}V_{\mathrm{Gal}_{3}}\,=\,0,$$
$$(20)$$

where Vk is the partial molar volume. Clearly, in the case of ideal gases it follows from (20)

$$\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{Gal}}\,=\,-\mathbf{J}_{\mathrm{Gal}_{3}}.$$
$$(21)$$

Combining Eqs. (12) and (22), we obtain for the local entropy production = + + at each point of the transport system s˙ s˙1 s˙2 s˙3

$$\begin{array}{c}\dot{s}={\bf J}_{Q}\nabla\!\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)\!-\frac{1}{T(1-x_{\rm Gal})}(\nabla\mu_{\rm Gal})_{T}\\ \\ +\frac{1}{T}A\,v\,\sum_{\gamma=1,2}\delta(\zeta_{\gamma}-z).\end{array}\tag{23}$$

In general, there may be more than two terms containing δ(ζγ - z), which corresponds to the existence of several condensed samples. In such systems, the condition of isothermality must be fulfilled: the temperature field must be uniform in the vicinity of point ζγ.

The total entropy production in a closed transport system,

$${\dot{S}}=\int_{V}\!\!{\dot{s}}d V,$$
$$(24)$$

is given by

$$\dot{S}=\int\limits_{0}^{l}\biggl{(}{\bf J}_{Q}\nabla\biggl{(}\frac{1}{T}\biggr{)}-\frac{1}{T(1-x_{\rm Gal})}(\nabla\mu_{\rm Gal})_{T}\biggr{)}d\tau\sigma\tag{25}$$ $$+\sum_{\gamma}\frac{1}{T_{\gamma}}A_{\gamma}v_{\gamma},$$

where σ is the cross-sectional area. Equation (25) contains two types of terms, differing in tensorial dimensionality: the fluxes and forces are vectors in the first two terms and scalars in the last term. Since the system is isotropic, the time variations of the vector and scalar components of entropy production must be assessed separately.

Equation (25) can also be derived under more general assumptions as to the configuration of the system.

Let the dimensions of the solid phase be relatively large, but the temperature be constant throughout the solid phase owing to the heater design. One solid phase may then be present in several neighboring elementary volumes. However, since the value of A is the same in each elementary volume within the solid phase, as is the value of T, the integration over its length reduces to summing up the values of v with the common multiplier A/T. In the thermodynamics of irreversible processes, the reaction rate v is in general an extensive
   2004

$$(18)$$

quantity [21]. Therefore, formula (21) is valid if the temperature is constant throughout the solid phase.

Consider the component

$$\dot{S}^{\tau}\,=\,\sum_{\gamma}\frac{1}{T_{\gamma}}A_{\gamma}v_{\gamma}$$

of the total entropy production (25), related to chemical reactions. At time-independent boundary conditions (T1 and T2 in our case), the relation

$$\nu_{1}d A_{1}+\nu_{2}d A_{2}\leq0,$$

is fulfilled at any instant in time [21], equality being only achieved in a steady state. Since the reactions at points ζ1 and ζ2 are independent, the conditions of a steady state may have the form A1 = const and A2 =
const at arbitrary vi, or v1 = v2 = 0 at arbitrary Ai.

The boundary conditions imposed on the system are not connected with A1 or A2. In a closed system, reaction (1) may alter the compositions of solid phases and, as a consequence, A1 and A2. Generally, any nonzero A1 and A2 then cannot remain constant. The only exception is the system in which one of the phases fully disappears in the course of an irreversible reaction. This case is trivial and will be left out of consideration in what follows. Thus, the only possible constant value of chemical affinity in a steady state is zero:

$$A_{1}\,=\,0,\,\,A_{2}\,=\,0;\,\,v_{1}\,=\,0,\,\,v_{2}\,=\,0.$$
$$(27)$$

In considering the contribution of vector quantities to the entropy production, we will neglect vapor-phase thermal diffusion processes. In addition, we assume that, in the nonequilibrium states under consideration, there are linear relations between fluxes Jk and forces Xk:

$$\mathbf{J}_{k}\,=\,L_{k}\mathbf{X}_{k}.\,{}^{2}$$
2 (28)
Then, at given temperatures T1 and T2 the functional

S˙3 JQ∇ 1T ---     1T --- JGaI 1 - xGaI ( ) ---------------------- ∇µGaI ( )T -     dV V ∫ = (29)
will be minimal under the condition [21]
∇µGaI ( )T = 0
(the theorem of a minimum in entropy production). As follows from the Gibbs–Duhem equation, the same condition must be fulfilled for GaI3:

$$(\nabla\mu_{\mathrm{Gal_{3}}})_{T}\,=\,0.$$
$$(31)$$

Thus, we have for a steady state

$$\nabla p_{\mathrm{Gal}}\,=\,0,\quad\nabla p_{\mathrm{Gal_{3}}}\,=\,0.$$
$$(32)$$

Let the system contain two solid phases, maintained at temperatures T1 and T2. Then, it follows from (32) that, in a steady state, the equalities

$$P_{\rm Gal}(T_{1})=p_{\rm Gal}(T_{2}),\quad p_{\rm Gal_{3}}(T_{1})=p_{\rm Gal_{3}}(T_{2})\tag{33}$$

are fulfilled even if $T_1\neq T_2$. 
Combining (33) and (4), we find that the compositions of the condensed phases (sample and getter) in the transport system approach a steady state in such a way that

$$k_{p}(T_{1})\,=\,k_{p}(T_{2}).$$
$$(34)$$

The state in which conditions (33) are fulfilled corresponds to a minimum in entropy production, playing the role of the scattering potential, which passes through a minimum in a steady state. Such a steady state is unique for each T1 and T2. A change in T2 (at constant T1) or T1 (at constant T2) must lead to additional compositional changes via the removal or introduction of gallium and to a new steady state, with a time-independent sample composition.

Relation (34), derived without using experimental results, makes it possible to gain information about the relationship between the chemical potentials of gallium (the component being transported) in the sample and gallium source (getter).

Using Eqs. (7) and (8), relation (34) can be written in the form

$\left(28\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}$
2µGa cond T2 x2 ( ) , F T2 + ( ) T2 ----------------------------------------------------- 2µGa cond T1 x1 ( ) , F T1 + ( ) T1 = -----------------------------------------------------, (35)
$$(30)$$
where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the gallium source (getter) and the sample, respectively, and the quantities F(T2) and F(T1) are given by Eq. (8). If equality (34) is fulfilled, there is no mass transport in the system, that is, a steady state is reached.

Equation (35) is derived for a particular vapor transport system. It is however obvious that this equation can be applied, with insignificant changes, to other vapor transport systems in which there is only one reversible reaction between the condensed sample and the source (getter) of the component being transported.

It can be seen from Eq. (35) that, at a given transporting agent, the composition of the sample being

$$(26)$$
$${\mathrm{;~}}T_{1}{\mathrm{;~and~}}$$

annealed in a steady state depends on three parameters, which are to be adjusted in each experiment:
source (getter) composition, x1; source (getter) temperature, T1; and sample temperature, T2.

The effect of the chemical nature of the transporting agent is represented by the terms F(T2) and F(T1).

The question that now arises is whether relations
(34) and (35), corresponding to a minimum in entropy production, are fulfilled in practice. To clarify this issue, consider the evolution of a sample–vapor–source (getter) transport system in which reaction (3) takes place at arbitrary sample and source (getter) temperatures and compositions. In the initial state, T2 ≠ T1 and the quantities

$$\Phi_{2}=\frac{2\mu_{\rm Ga}^{\rm cond}(T_{2},x_{2})+F(T_{2})}{T_{2}}\tag{36}$$
$$\mathrm{and}$$
$$\Phi_{1}=\frac{2\mu_{\rm Ga}^{\rm cond}(T_{1},x_{1})+F(T_{1})}{T_{1}}\tag{37}$$

differ from one another.

As Φ1 and Φ2 approach one another, four distinct situations may occur. In each of them, Φ1 and Φ2 vary as a result of variations in the compositions (x1 and x2)
of the condensed phases.

1. According to the Gibbs–Duhem equation, a decrease in the chemical potential of one component of a condensed phase upon the redistribution of the component being transported between the sample and source (getter) leads to an increase in the chemical potential of the other component of this condensed phase. As a result, a substantial fraction of the latter may vaporize (the volatility of the phase increases), or this component may react with the transporting agent (breaking the condition that the reaction between the vapor and condensed phases must be selective). In both instances, the second and fourth conditions above are not fulfilled. Vaporization of the two components of a binary phase leads to classical CVT, which results in resublimation of all the substance.

The difference between $\frac{2\mu_{\rm Ga}^{\rm cond}(T_{1},x_{1})+F(T_{1})}{T_{1}}$ and 
2µGa

$${\frac{(T_{2},x_{2})+F(T_{2})}{T_{2}}}\,\operatorname{dcc}$$

 decreases to a certain level but does not become zero, and conditions (33) and (34) cannot be fulfilled: even under steady-state (in a broad sense) conditions, there is a nonzero diffusion flux, which breaks down the system. For example, for condition (35) to be fulfilled in the vapor transport system sampleGa–Se–vaporGa–I–Ga source/getterGa–Se, the sample must be highly deficient in Ga (xGa < 0.4).

This leads to a high Se vapor pressure, and NVT becomes impossible.

2. The relationships between the chemical potential of component A in the condensed phase and those of vapor species are such that kp(T2, x2) or kp(T1, x1) is very large ( ∞) or very small ( 0) (large displacement of equilibrium). As a result, the vapor phase contains only one molecular species, instead of two, and, because there is no carrier gas, the transport ceases before conditions (34) and (35) are fulfilled. This situation arises, e.g., in transport systems

  **sample${}_{\text{In}}$** or **InS (In-enriched)-Vapor${}_{\text{In}}$** halides-In source/geetter${}_{\text{In}}$** metals
sampleIn–S–vaporindium halides–In source/getterIn metal, where the only vapor species present in a significant amount is InCl, and NVT is also impossible.

3. The chemical potentials of the phase-forming components of the sample or Ga source (getter) are beyond the stability limits of the corresponding phase, and another condensed phase appears. The composition of this phase also varies in such a way that the entropy production decreases. Thus, the desired phase cannot always be obtained by such heat treatment: the quantities

$$\frac{2\mu_{\mathrm{Ga}}^{\mathrm{cond}}(T_{2},x_{2})+F(T_{2})}{T_{2}}\quad\mathrm{and}\quad\frac{2\mu_{\mathrm{Ga}}^{\mathrm{cond}}(T_{1},x_{1})+F(T_{1})}{T_{1}}$$

may differ so markedly that no variations in T2 and T1 will bring the source (getter) and sample to a steady state with zero mass transport. Such a situation occurs in systems where the composition of indium(III) sulfide probably cannot be varied in the presence of an indium metal source (getter). In this case, one is confronted with a nonthermal variation in the chemical potential of the component being transported (this issue will be addressed in Section 4).

4. Finally, if the chemical potentials of components in the sample and source (getter) differ not very markedly, one might expect that, as a result of correlated variations in the sample and source (getter) compositions, conditions (34) and (35) will be fulfilled, with no changes in the phase composition of the system. (Experimental data for such a system are presented in Section 3.)
   2004 The last case is of special interest. To alleviate the problem of predicting sample composition, it is convenient to fix the composition of the source (getter) of the component to be transported (x1), thereby eliminating one of the variables from consideration. The sample composition (x2) is then a function of only two variables, T2 and T1: x2 = f(T2, T1) [see Eq. (35)]. Geometrically, this can be represented by a T2–T1–x2 threedimensional diagram, showing the stability regions of the phases involved. The physical interpretation of x2–
T2–T1 diagrams is that the sample composition depends on T2 and T1. Taking into account Eq. (14) and the properties of the chemical potential, we conclude that, in the stability regions of phases of variable composition, to each nonstoichiometric composition correspond particular values of T2 and T1 (conformity principle), and continuous variations in T2 and/or T1 are accompanied by continuous variation in sample composition
(continuity principle).

Note that the x2–T2–T1 diagram of a system in a steady state with no mass transport is very similar to classical p–T–x phase diagrams.

Instead of x2–T2–T1 diagrams, it is often more convenient to use x2–∆T–T1 or x2–T2–∆T diagrams, in which one variable, T2 or T1, is replaced by the temperature difference ∆T = T2 - T1.

Recall that, to adequately construct an x2–T2–T1 diagram or its projections, the source (getter) composition x1 must remain unchanged as the transport system approaches a steady state. (Clearly, the same refers to x2–∆T–T1 and x2–T2–∆T diagrams.)
The value of x1 can be maintained constant in three ways:
using a large amount of source (getter) material
(several orders of magnitude larger than the sample weight),
using a mixture of two binary condensed phases close in composition, and using the pure component involved in the reaction with the transporting agent.

The last approach is the best suited to control over the composition of gallium selenides. Consider the variation of the composition of a Ga–Se alloy with ∆T
(Fig. 2) for a transport system in which pure Ga metal

![6_image_0.png](6_image_0.png)

is used as the Ga source (getter), and the vapor phase consists of gallium iodides. Clearly, the source (getter)
temperature T1 in such a system must be either lower than or equal to the sample temperature T2; otherwise, all of the Ga metal would be transferred to the sample zone.

µ2 Ga ( )
condµ1 Ga ( )
cond At T2 = T1, we have = , which is possible if the selenide sample transforms into pure gallium
(infinite dilution of the alloy with gallium). For T2 > T1
(the sample temperature exceeds the source (getter)
temperature, ∆T > 0), the Ga content of the sample decreases until a new steady state with no mass transport sets in, corresponding to the temperatures T2 and T1. Note that, if ∆T varies continuously and monotonically, and a steady state (no Ga transport) is reached at each point, the composition of the sample being annealed will only vary continuously and monotonically in some composition ranges, corresponding to the homogeneity ranges of the phases being annealed. In contrast, the transition from one phase to another must occur jumpwise. For example, in the transport system sampleunsaturated Se solution in Ga–vaporgallium iodides–Ga source/getterGa metal with T2 < 1154 K and T1 > 670 K,3 a continuous, monotonic increase in ∆T (at constant T1) must lead to the following consecutive transformations of the sample:
a continuous, monotonic increase in the selenium content of saturated gallium solutions up to the GaL–
GaSeS liquidus (Fig. 2);
a sharp change in sample composition due to the transformation of the saturated solution into GaSe
(GaL–GaSeS two-phase region);

Se3 S
continuous, monotonic variation in the stoichiometry of the GaSe-based phase up to its highest selenium content (within the homogeneity range of the GaSe phase);
sharp changes in sample composition and structure due to the transformation of GaSe into Ga2Se3 (GaSeS–
Ga2Se two-phase region); 3 S
a continuous, monotonic increase in the selenium content of the Ga2Se3-based phase within its homogeneity range.

Further increase in ∆T and, accordingly, in the Se content of Ga2Se3 will be accompanied by a significant increase in the vapor pressure of component B (Se). A
continuous decrease in ∆T (at constant T1) must lead to the reverse sequence of transformations.

The temperature range in which NVT may be of practical interest depends on the process conditions (see the beginning of this section) and the kind of the phase diagram (it only makes sense to control the compositions of solid phases). For example, in the transport system under consideration this temperature range extends from about 673 K (the vapor phase contains significant amounts of both GaI and GaI3) to 1100 K
(melting point of GaSe).

NVT conditions can be represented by T1–T2–x2,
∆T–T2–x2, or T1–∆T–x2 diagrams, which correspond to the p–T–x phase diagram. For example, the stability region of each phase in such a diagram is represented by a surface bounded by the lines of a partial equilibrium (in the zone at temperature T2) involving two binary condensed phases and the vapor phase with the participation of the transporting agent. It is, however, more convenient to use T1–T2 projections of such diagrams. It is reasonable to expect that, in such projections, the stability field of each condensed phase in the A–B system is represented by a certain region bounded by the lines of a three-phase (at temperature T2) equilibrium (two binary condensed phases + vapor phase with the participation of the transporting agent) (Fig. 3).

Indeed, the condition that the chemical potentials of the components of equilibrium condensed phases must be equal allows the sample composition to be eliminated from the set of variables in Eqs. (34) and (35).

The variation of kp with T2 for the three-phase equilibrium under consideration can then be assessed using vapor-pressure measurements. Coupled with temperature-dependent kp data for the source/getter–vapor equilibrium, such results make it possible to calculate the stability limits (in T1–T2 projections) of phases existing in steady-state NVT systems. In this work, such calculations are performed for the vapor transport system sampleGa–Se–vaporgallium iodides–Ga source/getterGa metal.

In earlier studies, using vapor-pressure measurements with a Bourdon gage [19, 24], kp was determined for various three-phase equilibria (two binary condensed Ga–Se phases + gallium iodide vapor) in the Ga–Se–I system (Table 1). The results, obtained under near-equilibrium conditions, were used to calculate, using relation (34), the T2–T1 projection of the x2–T2–T1 diagram for the condensed phases in a nonequilibrium steady state without mass transport in the vapor transport system in question. The projection is displayed in Fig. 3. (Since the system under consideration contains Ga metal as the Ga source (getter), we

It should be emphasized that steady-state conditions in a nonisothermal NVT system (under the assumption that the vapor pressures of the constituent components are negligible) differ drastically from nonisothermal (two-zone) annealing with no transporting agent. As is well known, the steady-state conditions in the latter case, without mass transport, are defined by

## 3. Evaluation And Control Of Nonstoichiometry In Gase

In this section, we present experimental evidence that the nonstoichiometry (and, hence, the properties) of GaSe can be controlled using NVT. In addition, we locate the stability fields of various GaSe polytypes in the T–x and T2–T1 diagrams and establish the NVT conditions for the preparation of a given polytype.

As shown earlier [19, 24, 25], GaSe has a rather narrow homogeneity range (<0.15 mol %) below 1093 K,
which impedes determination of its stoichiometry by roentgenoluminescence, x-ray fluorescence analysis, and Auger electron spectroscopy. Electrical measurements are also inapplicable because the transporting agent (iodine) is likely to be electrically active in GaSe.

   2004 In this work, to determine the composition of GaSe within its homogeneity range we use x-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements of lattice parameters and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy.

## 3.1 Synthesis

GaSe single crystals were prepared by directional solidification of the stoichiometric melt [26]. In annealing experiments, we used plates 1 × 1 × 0.2 cm in dimensions, cut from the ingot. The composition of GaSe was varied using both isothermal and nonisothermal iodide NVT.

Nonisothermal process. Single-crystal GaSe plates were placed at one end of a silica tube 1.1–1.2 cm in diameter, and a small amount (1 g) of metallic gallium was placed at the other end of the tube. The tube also contained a weighed amount of GaI3 placed in a small open container. GaI3 synthesis and the procedure we used to transfer the synthesized GaI3 to the tube were described elsewhere [19, 24]. The GaI3 weight was chosen so that, at an average temperature of 1000 K, the unsaturated GaI3 vapor pressure was 3 × 104 Pa. The tubes (10 to 25 cm in length) were evacuated and sealed off [14].

The source (getter) temperature T1 depended on the tube length (Fig. 4).

We carried out three series of nonisothermal NVT
experiments, with sample temperatures T2 = 962, 1073, and 1093 K. T2 was maintained constant within each series, while the source (getter) temperature T1 was varied. In each series, several tubes of different lengths were introduced into the furnace. The length of each tube was chosen so as to ensure, with consideration for

![9_image_0.png](9_image_0.png)

the temperature profile of the furnace, the desired temperature T1 of the cold end, where gallium metal collected. After annealing for 110 h, the samples were quenched in cold water. Next, the samples were withdrawn from the tubes and rinsed with ethanol to remove gallium iodides from their surfaces. In this way, in each series of experiments we obtained a set of samples in which the gallium (selenium) content depended on T1 and lied within the homogeneity range of GaSe.

Isothermal process. This process was used to obtain compositions at the boundaries of the GaSe homogeneity range. Since, in the case of an isothermal vapor transport system, condition (35) for a steady state simplifies to the equality of the chemical potentials of gallium, it is convenient to use the sample compositions corresponding to the boundaries of the GaSe homogeneity range. For example, using Ga + GaSe and GaSe +
Ga2Se3 mixtures as a source (getter), one can reach, respectively, the Ga-rich and Se-rich phase boundaries of GaSe.

The isothermal process was run in the same way as the nonisothermal process except that the temperature gradient in the furnace was much lower (<2–4 K for 8 cm). As the source (getter) material, we used GaSe +
Ga and GaSe + Ga2Se3 alloys, instead of metallic gallium. The sample and source (getter) were placed at the opposite ends of the tube.

Two-step heat treatment was performed in a horizontal tubular furnace with an isothermal zone about 10 cm in length. In the first step, in order to eliminate Ga2Se3 inclusions all of the samples were annealed in the presence of a GaSe + Ga source (getter) at 973 K for 50 h. In the second step, each sample was heat-treated at a preset temperature in the presence of a GaSe + Ga or GaSe + Ga2Se3 source (getter) for an additional 60 h.

Just as in the nonisothermal process, isothermal annealing was followed by sample quenching and rinsing. In this way, we obtained samples saturated with selenium and gallium at 1073, 1093, 1123, and 1173 K.

## 3.2. Xrd Characterization

Powder XRD studies were carried out on a DRON4.07 diffractometer with filtered CuKα radiation. XRD
patterns were collected in two steps. First, a survey scan was performed in the 2θ range 10°–86° with a step size
∆(2θ) = 0.1°. Next, the angular ranges containing diffraction peaks were scanned with a step size ∆(2θ) =
0.02°. The counting time per data point was 15 s.

Since GaSe has an extremely low hardness, powders for XRD studies were prepared with care, so as to avoid stress buildup and the associated broadening of diffraction peaks: the samples were comminuted with a platinized blade for several hours, instead of grinding in a mortar. Next, the powders were sieved through a finemesh sieve cloth to separate coarse particles. As a result, the average particle size did not exceed 0.1 mm in any direction. Further sample preparation included standard steps (addition of Vaseline, mounting in a sample holder, and others).

In preliminary powder XRD data processing (background elimination, precision determination of peak position by the second-derivative method, etc.), we used the Powder X program [27, 28]. In each XRD pattern, we analyzed 16 to 20 peaks with d spacings from 1 to 8 Å (2θ range from 10° to 90° for CuKα radiation).

The phase composition of the samples was determined

![10_image_0.png](10_image_0.png)

by comparing experimental XRD data with diffraction patterns calculated for expected phases using structural data reported in the literature and the PowderCell 2.3 program [29, 30]. If this procedure had limited success, the phase composition was determined by the Rietveld profile analysis method [31], using PowderCell 2.3 [29, 30] and QUANTO [32]. Lattice parameters were refined with UnitCell [33].

## 3.3. Cvt Annealing Conditions And Stability Regions Of Gase Polytypes

GaSe polytypism (literature survey). Gallium monoselenide is a classic layered compound. Its structure is made up of –Se–Ga–Ga–Se– four-layer slabs linked by van der Waals forces [34; 35, p. 288]. GaSe exists in a number of polytypes, which differ in the stacking sequence of the slabs. All of the polytypes have hexagonal structures [36]. The β (2H), ε (2Ha) (two slabs per unit cell), and γ (three slabs per unit cell)
polytypes were reported to be thermodynamically stable phases. The structures of the β, ε, and γ polytypes are shown schematically in Fig. 5. Note that all of the layers and atoms in β-GaSe are crystal-chemically equivalent, in contrast to the ε and γ polytypes, which contain inequivalent layers.

As pointed out in a number of works [37–44], nonstoichiometry and heat-treatment conditions influence the structure of GaSe. For example, an excess of selenium leads to the formation of γ-GaSe [37–39], while gallium excesses are favorable for the formation of ε-GaSe [37, 39] or β-GaSe [38]. According to Balitskii et al. [40], the stable form at temperatures of up to 1155 K is ε-GaSe; at higher temperatures, the stable form is γ-GaSe. The effect of nonstoichiometry on the stability of the polytypes was not analyzed in that work. An important point in the context of further analysis is that, as reported in [40–42], γ-GaSe cannot be prepared in pure form and always contains inclusions of Ga2Se3, a more Ga-rich phase. The characteristic reflections from cubic Ga2Se3 are 111 (3.18 Å, 2θ = 28.3° for CuKα radiation), 220 (1.92 Å, ~47.6°), and 311 (1.64 Å,
~57°) [41, 42]. The origin of the Ga2Se3 impurity in GaSe was not discussed in [41, 42].

Stability regions of GaSe polytypes (experimental data). Note, first of all, that, judging from XRD patterns, the samples had a well-defined preferential orientation, which could not be reduced even by introducing an x-ray amorphous diluent (starch). For this reason, the strongest reflections were 00l with l = 2n for the 2H
polytypes (β and ε) and l = 3n for the 3R polytype
(γ-GaSe). The reflections with h ≠ 0 or k = 0 (which allow one to identify the polytype) were far weaker.

Annealing was found to have a significant effect on the XRD patterns of the samples (prepared by directional solidification).

1. The XRD patterns of the samples annealed at relatively high temperatures (T2 ~ 1073 K) and containing large excesses of selenium (nonisothermal anneal at
∆T  220 K or isothermal anneal in the presence of a GaSe + Ga2Se3 mixture) show reflections characteristic of the γ polytype: 012 (2θ ≈ 28.6°), 1 0 10 (2θ ~ 47.3°), and 1 0 11 (2θ ~ 50.5°) (Figs. 6, 7). The best defined reflection is 1 0 10: in spite of the strong preferential orientation, this reflection is well observed, because the (1 0 10) plane is only slightly off (001).

2. The XRD patterns of the other samples, with a lower selenium content at high temperatures (T2 ~
1073 K) or any nonstoichiometry at lower temperatures, differ very little. Annealing conditions (determining the stoichiometry of GaSe) have no effect (to within the measurement accuracy) on peak positions. These XRD patterns show only reflections characteristic of the 2H polytypes (ε and β) and no reflections from 3RGaSe (γ polytype).

The β (2H) and ε (2Ha) polytypes are more difficult to distinguish since their XRD patterns are very close in peak positions. To distinguish these phases, we used the intensities of the 100 and 101 reflections, which differ notably for the 2H and 2Ha polytypes (Fig. 6). It was found that all of the samples in question consisted of the ε polytype; β-GaSe was detected in none of the samples.

3. The unannealed crystal, prepared via solidification of the stoichiometric GaSe melt, was identified as the γ polytype (Fig. 7, scans 3). In addition, the crystal contained trace levels of monoclinic Ga2Se3, which suggests that the sample was microinhomogeneous. The lattice parameters of GaSe evaluated from powder XRD data are listed in Table 2. A few features of these results are worth noting.

(i) The lattice parameter c is a nonmonotonic function of ∆T, the parameter determining the stoichiometry of GaSe. After annealing at 962 K, c passes through a maximum at ∆T = 117 K, which corresponds to compositions far beyond the homogeneity range of GaSe. As the Se-rich phase boundary of GaSe is approached
(high ∆T values), c decreases again. The variation in a is comparable to the experimental error.

To compare the packing densities of layered phases, it is reasonable to use a quantity independent of the nature of polytypes. We used the unit-cell volume per four-layer (Se–Ga–Ga–Se) slab, V. The slab thickness is c/2 in ε-GaSe and c/3 in γ-GaSe. Figure 8 shows the plot of V versus ∆T. As seen, V also passes through a maximum, which implies that the samples with intermediate Se contents (moderate ∆T values), annealed at both 962 and 1093 K, have the lowest density.

(ii) GaSe samples annealed in iodide vapor and without it (in direct contact with a GaSe + Ga or GaSe +
Ga2Se3 mixture) differ little (≤1%) in lattice parameters and V (Table 2), which indicates, albeit indirectly, that the iodine solubility in gallium monoselenide is rather low.

(iii) The samples heat-treated at high temperatures have a denser structure (Fig. 8).

The results above demonstrate that, by varying iodide NVT conditions, one can control not only the nonstoichiometry of GaSe but also its structure.

It seems likely that annealing at relatively low T2
(962 K) always leads to the formation of ε-GaSe. This polytype is also stable at higher temperatures (1073– 1093 K), but only under conditions favorable for Ga enrichment of GaSe (nonisothermal annealing at ∆T =
0–174 K in the presence of metallic gallium or isothermal annealing with a GaSe + Ga source (getter)). The high stability of ε-GaSe is attributable to the highest degree of ordering of the interstices in its structure. At T2 above 1073 K, two phases may be thermodynamically stable: ε-GaSe and γ-GaSe. Annealing under conditions resulting in Se enrichment leads to the formation of γ-GaSe (nonisothermal annealing with Ga at
∆T  220 K or isothermal annealing with a GaSe +
Ga2Se3 source (getter)). The existence of two stable polytypes may result in a two-phase region between the ε and γ phases in the T–x phase diagram of GaSe
(Fig. 9).

Some changes are also expected in the stability regions of phases in the T2–T1–x2 diagram. Given the coexistence of two polytypes, the refined T2–T1 projection of this diagram for the GaSe phase region in iodide NVT with a Ga metal source (getter) must have the form shown in Fig. 10.

To assess the effect of heat-treatment conditions on the crystal composition, consider the variation of c or V
with ∆T (Fig. 8). It follows from the nonmonotonic variation in V that the compositions close to the center of the homogeneity range have the loosest crystal lattice. This situation is possible if the loosest lattice corresponds to the stoichiometric composition of GaSe.

This composition must have the lowest density of point defects. If vacancies are the dominant defect species in the crystal, both Ga- and Se-enriched samples must have reduced lattice parameters and V. The same is, in principle, possible in the case of defects residing between slabs (intercalation defects) if the atoms accommodated in the van der Waals gaps strongly interact with atoms of the neighboring slabs, thereby "linking" them. For example, the incorporation of Co atoms in the layered compound TiS2 increases the density of the intercalation compound CoxTiS2 [45].

Thus, we are led to assume that a GaSe-based phase
(presumably the ε polytype, formed in most of our experiments) is located on the two sides of the stoichiometric composition and that vacancies are the dominant defect species at moderate temperatures (≤1073 K).

3.4. Cathodoluminescence and Nonstoichiometry of GaSe after NVT 
To assess the nonstoichiometry of GaSe, we used the cathodoluminescence (CL) spectra of the same samples, differing in Ga content, as were used in XRD studies (Table 2).

CL was preferred to other luminescence spectroscopies because it probes a relatively thick layer, which reduces the effect of the surface condition on the emission of interest.

CL was excited by a 40-keV electron beam at 77 K
and an average current of 0.5 µA and was detected using a ZhS-17 optical filter and FEU-79 photomultiplier tube.

According to earlier results [46–48], the emission spectrum of GaSe depends strongly on excitation conditions. At current densities on the order of 0.1 A/cm2, the spectrum shows several groups of bands, of which two are particularly strong. One of these bands
(2.056−2.071 eV) arises from resonant excitonic recombination. The other strong band (2.089–2.095 eV) is due

![13_image_0.png](13_image_0.png)

![14_image_0.png](14_image_0.png)

to radiative transitions with the participation of point defects. The density and nature of point defects in the system under consideration depend on the stoichiometry of the samples, which varies in the course of heat treatment. Therefore, the intensity of the latter band provides at least a qualitative measure of compositional changes within the homogeneity range of GaSe.

It is reasonable to assume that the higher energy band must be stronger at lower densities of point defects. Recall that, according to XRD data, the stoichiometric composition of GaSe lies within its homogeneity range, and the samples with intermediate nonstoichiometries (annealed at moderate ∆T values) must be more perfect.

Indeed, it can be seen in Figs. 11a and 11b that the samples annealed at T2 = 962 or 1073 K and ∆T intermediate between 0 and 220 K show the strongest emission in the range 2.089–2.095 eV. (At ∆T  0, the sample must contain the highest concentration of gallium; at ∆T ≈ 220 K, the sample must contain the largest excess of selenium [14].)
After annealing at 1093 K (Fig. 11c), the higher energy emission is characteristic of the sample which is expected to be enriched in gallium (∆T = 33 K). This may indicate, albeit indirectly, that the homogeneity range shifts to more Se-rich compositions and that the Ga-rich phase boundary of GaSe is close to the stoichiometric composition. The assumed shift fits well with the homogeneity range of gallium monoselenide inferred from vapor pressure measurements [19, 48].

These data are also consistent with the fact that GaSe crystals without Ga2Se3 impurity cannot be prepared by directional solidification or annealing above 1123 K. The likely reason for the Ga2Se3 precipitation is that, with decreasing temperature, the homogeneity range of gallium monoselenide shifts to higher selenium contents [19, 24].

![15_image_0.png](15_image_0.png)

![15_image_1.png](15_image_1.png)

The high defect density in unannealed GaSe is evidenced by the low-energy luminescence features (2.044 and 2.052 eV) and the long-wavelength tail of the 2.44-eV band in the spectrum of this sample (Fig. 11b). The same features, though less pronounced, indicate that the crystal annealed at T2 = 1093 K and ∆T = 221 K
(γ polytype) also contains a significant density of defects.

Thus, the effect of annealing conditions on the intensity of the band between 2.089 and 2.095 eV can be used to assess the nonstoichiometry of GaSe.

## 4. Cvt As A Means Of Controlling The Composition Of Indium Sulfides Using In1 - Xaux Melts As Indium Sources (Getters) 4.1. Theoretical Analysis

In the Ga–Se system, the nonstoichiometry of GaSe in the presence of metallic Ga as a source (getter) can be controlled by varying two of the three process parameters: sample temperature T1 and source (getter) temperature T2.

In the In–S system, which contains several low-volatile compounds, varying the source (getter) and sample temperatures is insufficient for controlling the nonstoichiometry of the sample. In this system, we varied the three NVT parameters, including the source (getter) composition.

Halide NVT of indium sulfides is possible owing to the following:
1. The compounds existing in the In–S system
(Fig. 12) (InS, In6S7, and In2S3) are low-volatile [49–
54] (p < 10 Pa at their melting points).

2. In the In–Hal (Hal = Cl, Br, I) systems, the vapor phase contains InHal, In2Hal4, InHal3, and some other halides. The dominant vapor species over condensed lower indium chlorides are InHal and In2Hal4 [53].

3. Indium thiohalides, InSHal, exist only in the condensed state and sublime incongruently, so that the vapor phase contains only indium halides [53, 55, 56]. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that no ternary compounds are formed at temperatures above 773 K
and vapor pressures above 2.5 × 104 Pa.

4. In the S–Hal (Hal = Cl, Br, I) systems at temperatures above 673 K, sulfur halides decompose almost entirely in the vapor phase [57]. Therefore, the concentrations of such halides in the vapor phase over indium sulfides, which possess reducing properties, must be negligible.

The two assumptions above were checked in special experiments. To this end, In–S alloys with xS = 0.32, 0.40, 0.52, and 0.55 (sample weight of about 0.1 g) were annealed for 48 h in unsaturated indium chloride vapor
(pInCl = 104 Pa at 733 K and 2.5 × 104 Pa at 833 K) and then quenched. As a result, the tube contained condensed indium chlorides at one end and the In–S alloy at the other. Subsequent XRD examination of the alloys revealed only indium and indium sulfides. Quantitative chemical analysis showed that the condensed indium chlorides contained no sulfur, which confirms the

![16_image_0.png](16_image_0.png)

S118

![17_image_0.png](17_image_0.png)

assumption that the vapor phase over indium sulfides contains no sulfur or its compounds.

Thus, we are led to conclude that the chemical transport in the vapor transport system under consideration is due to the selective reaction

$$2\mathrm{In}^{\mathrm{cond}}+\mathrm{In}_{2}\mathrm{Hall}_{4}^{\mathrm{v}}\rTo4\mathrm{In}\mathrm{Hall}^{\mathrm{v}},$$
$$(39)$$
$k_{p}=\frac{P_{\rm in}{\rm Hal}}{P_{\rm in}{\rm H}{\rm al}_{4}}$, (40)
as confirmed by the data reported in [53, 57–63]. (In reaction (39), Incond stands for indium in a condensed phase, e.g., in a sulfide).

By analogy with earlier studies [14], indium metal was first used as a source (getter). However, varying only the temperature gradient in the system sampleindium sulfide–vaporindium halides–source/getterIn metal was insufficient for appreciable indium transport from the sulfides to the source (getter). For this reason, all of the samples with xS < 0.50 converted to InS (Fig. 12),
independent of the experimental conditions, and compositional control was impossible. Even in a simplified vapor transport system containing indium metal instead of indium sulfide, no vapor transport took place. Those experiments were run for 5 days, the temperatures were varied in the ranges T2 = 673–1273 K and ∆T = T2 –
T1 = 100–600 K, and the indium halide concentration was from 0.15 to 2.1 mol/m3. The reason for the lack of transport is that, above 673 K, reaction (39), with the participation of pure liquid indium, is shifted almost entirely to the right [59–61], and the equilibrium constant (40) tends to infinity. Accordingly, the vapor phase contains little or no In2Hal4, a vapor species capable of bringing the halogen back to the source (getter), and indium transport proves impossible. With allowance made for the relation between kp and the chemical potential of indium in any of the condensed phases present
[Eqs. (7), (8)], the lack of indium transport can be accounted for by the high chemical potential of indium,
, in the metallic In source (getter):
µ1In

$$\mu_{1_{\mathrm{{ln}}}}\,=\,1/2R T\mathrm{ln}\,k_{p}+F^{\prime}(T),$$
$$(41)$$

where the term F'(T) depends on temperature only and is related to the standard potentials of the halides by

$$F(T)\,=\,1/2\mu_{\mathrm{In}_{2}\mathrm{Hal}_{4}}^{0}-2\mu_{\mathrm{InHal}}^{0}.$$
$$(42)$$

µ1In µ1In µ1In µ1In 0 The chemical potential in the source (getter)
can be reduced in two ways:
using chemical compounds with a reduced chemical potential of indium or using solutions of indium in a metallic host. One would expect that indium dilution will be accompanied by a decrease in indium activity and, accordingly, in since = + RTlnaIn. As follows from Eq. (40), this will lead to a reduction in kp and, hence, a rise in the concentration of In2Hal4, a vapor species necessary for indium transport from the sample to the getter.

As an example, consider the reduction in chemical potential with the use of the higher indium sulfide In2S3
[64]. The phase relations in the In–S system (Fig. 12)
suggest that the indium in In2S3 is bonded much stronger compared to the lower sulfides, which shifts equilibrium (38) to the left. For lack of data on the properties of the phases in the In–S system, preference was given to the latter approach: indium dilution.

The diluent R must meet the following requirements:
1. Its vapor pressure must be negligible (this requirement can be replaced by chemical inertness and a negligible solubility of R in the sample).

2. It must be nonreactive with the transporting agent.

3. The resulting solution (In + R) must exhibit no significant deviations from ideality (the indium activity in the solution must be always below unity).

The diluent used in this work is gold, which meets all of the requirements above. Indeed, under the conditions of this study, gold is nonreactive with halogens:
gold halides are strong oxidants and are unstable above 723 K [56]. Thermodynamic analysis of the reaction

$$6{\rm InCl}^{V}+2{\rm AuCl}_{3}^{V}=2{\rm Au}^{S}+3{\rm In}_{2}{\rm Cl}_{4}^{V}\tag{43}$$

![18_image_0.png](18_image_0.png)

with the use of data from [65] indicates that the gold chloride content of the vapor phase must be no higher than 10–5 mol %.

The actual contents of these species in the vapor phase must be several orders of magnitude lower because the system contains reductants such as indium and its sulfides.

The Au–In system contains several low-meltingpoint intermetallic phases (Fig. 13) [66]. The use of melts appears more attractive compared to intermetallic-based solid solutions from the viewpoint of the rate of indium exchange in the bulk of the source (getter).

As the transporting agent, we used chlorine (in the form of InCl), first, because indium chlorides have higher vapor pressures than do bromides and iodides [59–61, 67] and, second, because, by analogy with halides of some elements (Ga, Ge, Si, and others), we assumed that the oxidized form of indium halides
(In2Hal4) would be more stable in the chlorine compound.

In experiments with an indium source (getter), the composition of indium sulfides was controlled as follows:
1. First, the feasibility of the chloride transport of indium was assessed using the simplified system Au1 - x cond sampleIn metal–vaporIn–Cl–source/getter(Inx ),
containing no sulfur.

2. Next, examining the system InmSn–vaporIn–Cl–
InxAu1 - x, we evaluated the interrelated changes in the compositions of the indium sulfide sample ( ) and InxAu1 - x source (getter) ( ) arising from indium

CVT under the effect of the concentration gradient (isothermal process). After partial equilibrium (with respect to In) was achieved, we checked the correspondence between the sample and source (getter) compositions.

3. Finally, we examined the possibility of reversible changes in the sample and source (getter) compositions upon temperature variations (nonisothermal, two-zone process).

To reduce the chemical potential of indium, we used pure gold ( = 0) as the source (getter) and metallic indium as the sample. Indium transport, i.e., mass transfer between the sample and the source (getter), was examined using static gravimetry (Fig. 14) [14]. About 1 g of metallic indium (2N) was placed at one end of a tube, and a plate of refined gold (~0.1 g) was placed at the other end. The tube also contained InCl in an open capillary. (The synthetic procedure is described in the Appendix.) The amount of InCl was chosen so as to ensure an unsaturated vapor pressure pInCl = 2.5 ×
104 Pa at 1170 K. After evacuation and sealing off, silica rods were fused to the ends of the tube and were then suspended from threads (Fig. 14).

The process was first run at a constant temperature of 823 K. Indium CVT and dissolution in gold were easily observable: the Au plate fully melted at a temperature well below the melting point of gold, and the melt turned silvery white. According to the rate data (Fig. 15), indium was transported most rapidly in the µ1In

![19_image_0.png](19_image_0.png)

initial stages of the process, when the indium activity in the source (getter) was the lowest. At a later stage, the indium concentration and activity in the melt decreased; at xIn ≈ 0.55, the transport almost ceased.

The rate data (0.1 mol % accuracy in the compositions of In–Au alloys) were checked by an independent technique: after the experiment, the In–Al alloy was weighed. The compositions evaluated by the two methods coincided to within 1 mol %.

Experiments under nonisothermal conditions showed that temperature variations did not reverse the direction of mass transport, which implies that, in the system under consideration, the gold and forming In−Au solution act solely as an indium getter, rather than as a donor. This seems to be due to the large difference in chemical potential - , especially in the case of Au-rich In–Au solutions. (Recall, that subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the source (getter) and sample, respectively.) Thus, our results demonstrate that indium dilution with an inert (in the vapor phase) substance ensures indium CVT in at least one direction.

## 4.3. Isothermal Mass Transport

in the System InmSn–VaporIn–Cl–InxAu1 - x It was expected that InxAu1 - x melts might act both as indium getters and donors for InmSn samples (where m and n are integers for which µIn < ), in particular in isothermal processes. In such a system, CVT must lead to partial equilibrium with respect to the component being transported. The condition for this equilibrium is that the chemical potentials of indium in the sample and getter be equal:
µIn 0

$$\mu_{2_{\mathrm{in}}}\;=\;\mu_{1_{\mathrm{in}}}.$$
$$(44)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

It follows from condition (44) that, if the source
(getter) composition is varied continuously, one can obtain samples with different deviations from stoichiometry. In contrast, if a source (getter) of fixed composition is used in single-zone NVT, only the stoichiometric composition of the sample (x2) can be reached at a

given composition x1 and temperature (Section 3.1).

Thus, one would expect that, in an isothermal NVT process, sources (getters) of variable composition based on high-temperature solutions will have significant advantages over materials of fixed composition (pure components or their compound of particular stoichiometry).

We used chloride vapor transport to control the nonstoichiometry of In6S7 ( = 0.4615, ≈ 0.1 g) in the experimental geometry represented in Fig. 1. The source (getter) was InxAu1 - x with = 0.2–1.0. To accelerate the process, all of the samples were ground into fine powder. The amount of InCl was chosen so as to ensure an unsaturated InCl vapor pressure of 104 Pa.

The samples were annealed for 30 h at 823 and 923 K.

x2In mIn6S7 x1In Taking into account previous results [14], we expected that, under these conditions, the system was close to partial equilibrium (with respect to In). During cooling, indium chlorides were condensed in the central part of the tube in order not to contaminate the sample and charge. After the experiments, x-ray microanalysis revealed neither sulfur impurity in the source (getter) nor gold in the sample, which confirms the selective character of the transport process.

The observed changes in the color of the sulfide sample indicate that, in all our experiments, indium CVT took place, which changed the composition and color of both the sample and source (getter). In particular, a red, black, or dark brown color of the sample was considered evidence for the presence of β-In2S3 (with a

![21_image_0.png](21_image_0.png)

large excess of sulfur [68]), In6S7, or InS, respectively
[51–53] (Table 3).

The compositions of the condensed phases before and after heat treatment were evaluated gravimetrically and from XRD data. In interpreting XRD patterns, we used data from [52, 53] for InS and In6S7 and from [69, 70] for In2S3. The results (Table 3) correlate well and indicate the following:
1. The transport direction at T2 = T1 is governed by the initial sample and charge compositions. At high gold concentrations, indium is transported to the source (getter), and the indium content of the sample decreases. For example, if the source (getter) contains more than ~53 mol % Au, the In6S7 sample ( =
0.4615) converts to In2S3 (Table 3, runs 1–4, 7–10). At lower Au concentrations in the source (getter), indium is transported to the sample and dissolves in it. For example, if the source consists of In metal, the In6S7 sample converts entirely to InS (Table 3, run 5).

2. Since the source (getter) is homogeneous, the final sample composition depends not only on the initial compositions of the sample and source (getter) but also on their weights.

3. The sample and source (getter) compositions are interrelated: increasing the diluent concentration reduces the indium content of the sample. For example, In–Au alloys with = 0.65–0.73 correspond to β-In2S3, alloys with = 0.45–0.53 correspond to In6S7, and a pure In source corresponds to an InS sample (Table 3). (The only exception is run 1, presumably x2In x1Au x1Au because of the slow diffusion kinetics in the highest melting point source (getter) with = 0.80.)
x1Au These findings are represented in Fig. 16 as a sample composition–source (getter) composition diagram.

Such a diagram may include the compositions of the phases present in the initial, intermediate, and final, equilibrium (with respect to In) states, which allows one to follow variations in the compositions of the condensed phases in the NVT system.

As to the equilibrium (with respect to In) states represented in Fig. 16, one important point warrants attention. In the composition ranges where the sample is two-phase and the source (getter) is single-phase, the line representing the relationship between the sample and charge compositions must be vertical because to different bulk compositions of a two-phase sample corresponds the same chemical potential of indium, to which, in turn, corresponds a certain composition of a single-phase source (getter) (Fig. 16, dashed line). In contrast, a monotonic variation of the sample composition with the source (getter) composition in the diagram under consideration indicates that these compositions fall in the homogeneity range of some phase.

The results presented in Fig. 16 suggest that the homogeneity range of In2S3 is up to several molar percent in width. This is supported by the lattice parameters of In2S3. Using the program Crystallographic Search, we found that, of all the known In2S3 polymorphs [50, 53, 69, 70], only the β phase (tetragonal structure) was formed in our experiments. Its lattice parameters differed little from those reported by Rooymans
[69]: a = 7.77 Å, c = 32.32 Å. At equilibrium (with respect to In), the c parameter of this phase depended on the composition of the source (getter) coexisting with the sample (Table 3).

In addition, it was important to ascertain whether the indium transport between the sample and the charge was indeed due to an increase in the In2Cl4 concentration in the vapor phase. We assumed that, at lower chemical potentials of indium in the sample and source (getter) at partial equilibrium, the vapor phase was richer in In2Cl4 compared to InCl. In addition, we assumed that quenching had an insignificant effect on the relative amounts of these vapor species, which, therefore, can be assessed by analyzing the condensed phases. Qualitative information can be gained from the color of the condensed phases. It is well known that, with increasing Cl content, solid In–Cl phases change from colorless (In2Cl4 and InCl3) to yellow-orange
(InCl) [53, p. 56]. The color changes in the condensed chlorides were consistent with the above assumptions. The highest indium content of the source (getter) and sample (maximum µIn) corresponds to the brightest color of the condensed phases (Table 3, runs 1, 3) (minimum content of colorless, oxidized chloride species).

With decreasing indium concentration in the sample, the color of the condensed chlorides became less intense. Thus, our results demonstrate that reducing the indium concentrations in the sample and source (getter)
increases the In2Cl4 concentration in the vapor phase.

the CVT direction can be reversed by adjusting the chemical potentials of indium in the sample and source
(getter) via temperature variations. As shown in Section 2, the direction of mass transport under nonisothermal conditions depends not only on the source (getter)
composition but also on the sample and source (getter)
temperatures (T2 and T1, respectively). In is convenient to use the difference ∆T = T2 - T1 instead of T2 or T1: at constant T2 or T1, increasing ∆T reduces the concentration of the component being transported. The reversibility of nonisothermal indium transport was examined using static gravimetry.

First, a ground In–S alloy with the bulk composition
 = 0.48 was used as the sample. The alloy consisted of In and InS, as determined by XRD. As the source
(getter), we used a weighed amount of gold. The sample temperature was 823 K, and the charge temperature was - 783 K (∆T = 40 K). Curves 1 in Fig. 17 show the time dependences of the sample weight, sample composition, and charge composition. It follows from these data that indium extraction from the sample ceases at
 = 0.50 (InS). The corresponding source (getter)
composition is = 0.55. It seems likely that the chemical potential of indium in this melt is too high for further indium extraction via InS conversion to In6S7.

x2S
x2S
x1Au At the same time, InS conversion to In6S7 proved possible when the source (getter) temperature was reduced by 15 K (T2 = 823 K, T1 = 768 K, ∆T = 55 K).

As a result, we observed further indium transport from the sample to the source (getter), which ceased when the source (getter) composition was = 0.496
(Fig. 17, curves 2). The final sample composition was xS = 0.505, which corresponds to a mixture of InS and In6S7. As the indium content of the sample decreased, that of the source (getter) increased, which probably prevented full conversion of InS to In6S7.

x1Au In contrast, to reverse the direction of indium transport, we increased T1 (compared to the previous experiment), without changing the temperature T2 of the InS + In6S7 sample. After a relatively small increase in T2, the rate of indium transport was rather slow
(Fig. 17b, curve 3; T2 = 823 K, T1 = 933 K, ∆T = –110 K).

At the same time, after the source (getter) temperature T1 was raised to 1063 K (Fig. 17b, curve 4; ∆T =
−240 K), the rate of indium transport to the In–S sample was initially relatively fast. Under those conditions, 4.4. Nonisothermal Indium Transport in the System Sample (InmSn)–VaporIn–Cl–Indium Source 
(Getter) (InxAu1 - x) and NVT Reversibility One would expect that, in a nonisothermal system Sample (InmSn)–VaporIn–Cl–Indium Source (Getter) (InxAu1 - x),
mass transport ceased as a steady state with = 0.499
(which corresponds to InS within the present experimental accuracy) was reached.

Therefore, our results demonstrate that the direction of mass transport in the system under consideration depends not only on the sample and source (getter) compositions but also on the thermal conditions of the process.

Thus, the source (getter) dilution approach offers the following advantages:
1. Varying the concentration component of the chemical potential, one can control the equilibrium state of the system, which offers the possibility of using those phase compositions of the sample and transporting agent which are commonly believed to be unsuitable for reversible mass transport.

2. The proposed approach notably extends the capabilities of isothermal NVT. It was pointed out earlier that, if the charge belongs to the same binary system as the sample, a single-zone process allows one to reproducibly obtain only samples with compositions at the limits of the homogeneity range. In the approach in question, control over the activity of the component being transported allows one to obtain compositions lying within the homogeneity range. In nonisothermal NVT, a variety of sample compositions can be obtained by controlling the CVT direction with only two variable parameters: the sample and source (getter) temperatures.

## Conclusions

We developed a new approach to controlling the composition (nonstoichiometry) of low-volatile inorganic compounds. The basic principle of this approach is the introduction (or removal) of one of the components into the low-volatile compound using reversible selective CVT.

Theoretical analysis was used to identify the process parameters determining the direction of mass transport:
getter temperature T1, getter composition x1, and sample temperature T2.

Using nonequilibrium thermodynamics concepts, we established steady-state conditions under which mass transport ceases.

A new type of phase diagram, x2–T1–T2, was introduced, which describes the state of CVT systems under steady-state conditions without mass transport.

The proposed CVT process was used to prepare GaSe crystals with different deviations from stoichiometry.

The crystals were characterized using XRD and CL
spectroscopy. The stability regions of two GaSe polytypes in the T–x phase diagram were located.

CVT was used to control the compositions of phases in the In–S system.

The advantages of the CVT method were analyzed with application to control over the composition of inorganic compounds.

## Appendix

InCl was synthesized by melting a weighed amount of AgCl with a tenfold excess of indium metal. AgCl was prepared as described in [71], using Ag, HNO3, and HCl. To remove volatiles, in particular water, the AgCl precipitate was melted and held at 770 K for 0.5 h under dynamic vacuum (residual pressure of ~1 Pa).

InCl synthesis included the following steps: 1. First, we fabricated a silica ampule (Fig. 18a).

Weighed amounts of In and AgCl were placed between the bulbous joint and neck 2, and an upper neck was produced. Next, the ampule was evacuated and sealed off at the upper neck.

2. The ampule (Fig. 18b) was heated at 870 K for 10 h.

3. InCl was driven to the ampule end fitted with a coiled capillary, and the ampule was sealed off at the neck closest to the capillary (Fig. 18c). The tip of the capillary was broken off immediately before the introduction into the reaction system. Owing to its coiled shape, the capillary prevented atmospheric moisture from penetrating into InCl, which has a poor moisture resistance.

The purity of the indium chloride thus prepared was checked by vapor pressure measurements as described in [18, 24]. The temperature dependence of the vapor pressure over molten InCl was fitted to an equation of the form

with the best fit coefficients a = –4353.1 and b =
