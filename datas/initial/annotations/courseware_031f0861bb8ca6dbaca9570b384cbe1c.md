## 测验题 2

Albert Einstein was born in 1879. As a child, few people guessed that he a famous scientist whose theories would change the world.

A has been

was going to be
B had been

D was

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

本题考查动词的时态。

结合句意 “阿尔伯特爱因斯坦生于1879年。作为一个孩子的时候, 很少有人猜到他会成为一个提出的理论能改变世界的科学家” 可知, 横线部分表示过去将要发生的动作, 应用过去将来时, 仅有C项 was going to be 为过去将来时。故正确答案为 $C$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题 3

I had been working on math for the whole afternoon and the numbers before my eyes.
A swim
B swum
swam
D had swum

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

本句中前半句用的是过去完成进行时, 表示 “过去的过去” , 后半句中 swim 强调的是过去某个时间里发生的动作或存在的状态, 所以应该用一般过去时。故正确答案为 C。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题 4

A will make
B had made

makes

## 课堂测验

## 答案

D

## 解析

## 课堂测验

## 测验题 5

Last month, the Japanese government expressed their thanks for the aid they $\qquad$ from China.

A receive

C have received
B are receiving

D had received

## 课堂测验

## 答案

D

## 解析

由时间状语 “last month” 可知, 本句应该用过去时态。根据句意可知, receive 的动作应该发生在 express 之前, 所以用过去完成时，表示 “过去的过去”。故正确答案为 $D$ 。

描述一连串的过去动作，无需用过去完成时。

## 一般过去时与过去完成时的区别

## 用法小结

(1)$\cdot$一般过去时表示过去发生的动作或存在的状态；

$\cdot$过去完成时表示在过去某一动作发生在另一动作之前。

(2)有after或before引导的时间状语从句的复合句中，由于从句动作和主句动作发生的先后顺序已经非常明确所以可以用一般过去时代替过去完成时。

(3)描述一连串的过去动作，无需用过去完成时。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

The Russian rocket designer has died. For many years, he as a deputy to the father of Soviet space program.
A serves
B was serving
served
D has served

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

本题考查动词的时态。

题干意思为 “那位俄罗斯的火箭设计师去世了。之前他一直担任苏维埃太空项目之父的助手。” 根据句意, 可知担任助手是生前的事情, 与现在没有任何联系, 只强调过去的动作。故正确答案为 $C$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

- Did you enjoy meeting your old schoolmates at the party last week?
- Yes, I did. We $\qquad$ each other since we graduated from college.

A haven't seen B didn't see C hadn't seen D wouldn't see

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

结合上下句, 第二个说话者在上周已经见过了校友, 所以 “我们从毕业后就没有再见过对方” 是由过去的某一时刻开始, 一直延续到过去另一时间的动作或状态, 所以用过去完成时。故正确答案为 $C$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

- We've spent too much money recently.
- Well, it isn't surprising. Our friend and relatives $\qquad$ around all the time.

A coming

were coming
B had come

D have been coming

## 课堂测验

## 答案

D

## 解析

all the time 表明是从过去一直持续到现在的动作, 符合现在完成进行时的用法, 这个动作可能刚停止, 可能延续下去, 故正确答案为 $\mathrm{D}$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

- I'm sorry, but I don't quite follow you. Did you say you wanted to return on September 20?
- Sorry, I $\qquad$ myself clear. We want to return on October 20.

A hadn't made

C don't make
B wouldn't make

D haven't made

## 课堂测验

D

## 解析

本题考查动词的时态。

根据句意, 一不好意思, 我没能跟上你说的话。你刚才是说你想要9月20号回来吗?

一对不起, 我没表达清楚。我们想要10月20号回来。对方已经产生了误解, 说明 “说话者没有使别人明白” 这个动作发生在过去持续到现在，仍然没有使别人明白，所以用现在完成时。故正确答案为D。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

We ___ the computer problem, and got back online to continue our research.

A have solved B solve C would solve D solved

## 课堂测验

## 答案

D

## 解析

本题主要考查动词时态。

由于本句由 and 并列两个谓语, 结合句意可知两个动作是前后相继的, 其时态应当保持一致, 由 got back 可知空格处应该用一般过去时。故正确答案为D。

## Animals

Transparent(透明的) animals let light pass through their bodies the same way light passes through a window. These animals typically(典型地) live between the surface of the ocean and a depth of about 3,300 feet - as far as most light can reach. Most of them are extremely delicate(脆弱的) and can be damaged by a simple touch. Sonke Johnsen, a scientist in biology says, "These animals live through their life alone. They never touch anything unless they're eating it, or unless something is eating them."

And they are as clear as glass. How does an animal become seethrough? It's trickier than you might think. The objects around you are visible because they interact(互动) with light. Light typically travels in a straight line. But some materials slow and scatter (散射) light, bouncing(弹起) it away from its original path. Others absorb(吸收) light, stopping it dead in its tracks. Both scattering and absorption make an object look different from other objects around it, so you can see it easily.

## Animals

But a transparent object doesn't absorb or scatter light, at least not very much. Light can pass through it without bending(弯曲) or stopping. That means a transparent object doesn't look very different from the surrounding air or water. You don't see it - you see the things behind it.

To become transparent, an animal needs to keep its body from absorbing or scattering light. Living materials can stop light because they contain pigment (色素) that absorb specific(特定的) colors of light. But a transparent animal doesn't have pigments, so its tissues won't absorb light. According to Johnsen, avoiding absorption is actually easy. The real challenge is preventing light from scattering.

## Animals

Animals are built of many different materials - skin, fat, and more - and light moves through each at a different speed. Every time light moves into a material with a new speed, it bends and scatters. Transparent animals use different tricks to fight scattering. Some animals are simply(仅仅) very small or extremely flat. Without much tissue(组织) to scatter light, it is easier to be see-through. Others build a large, clear mass of non-living jelly-like (果冻状的) material and spread themselves over it.

## Animals

Larger transparent animals have the biggest challenge, because they have to make all the different tissues in their bodies slow down light exactly as much as water does. They need to look uniform（统一的). But how they're doing it is still unknown. One thing is clear for these larger animals, staying transparent is an active process. When they die, they turn a non-transparent milky white.
