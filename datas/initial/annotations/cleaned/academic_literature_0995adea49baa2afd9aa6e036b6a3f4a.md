also play a role in transduction of photic information in man. Parker and colleagues ${ }^{8}$, who studied the sleep-related prolactin rhythm in a group of young men, reported that each REM period was accompanied by a small drop in the otherwise elevated curve of prolactin secretion during nocturnal sleep.

Although there is much evidence to suggest that sleep may be more important than light in regulating a number of neuroendocrine cycles in man, blunting of the sleep-related growth hormone peak has been reported in blind humans, and monkeys kept in constant light lose the normal circadian rhythm of cyclic AMP in the cerebrospinal fluid3.4.

The anatomical route by which environmental light modulates central monoamine activity is still to be determined. In receipt of important projections from hypothalamus and limbic striatum, the ventral tegmental area of the mesencephalon is a junction, not only between limbic forebrain and mesencephalic monoamine centres, but could also receive direct information from the retina via several routes. One of these, the accessory optic tract, originates in specialized peripheral ganglion cells of the retina which project to the cerebellum via a multisynaptic pathway and whose axons terminate in a medial terminal nucleus which lies between the dopamine cells of the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area (Fig. 3). The ventral tegmental area is also traversed by the medial forebrain bundle which carries photic information from the suprachiasmatic nucleus to the thoracic cord, the superior cervical ganglion, and the pineal gland $^{6}$.

## Role of photic pulsing

On our rotating planet, the photoperiod to which all biological forms are exposed varies with season and can thus modulate exploratory, food-seeking, and reproductive behaviour in accordance with the most favourable times for survival. Although many factors appear to affect the activity cycle in the wild, while confined in the laboratory to an artificial 12:12 light:dark cycle, the daily activity rhythm of the rodent is strongly entrained by light. Lateral eye movements, and thus potentially REMs, apparently participate in linking the environmental light cycle to the circadian excitability of the mesolimbic catecholamine system.

As Sue Iversen has pointed out, the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity response in the rat is actually a manifesta- tion of greatly heightened exploratory activity $^{2}$. Under natural conditions, exploratory, foraging, and reproductive habits of most animal species are closely tied to daily and seasonal light changes. Thus, provision must be made for the eye regularly to send unambiguous information with respect to light and darkness to regions of the brain which regulate these functions. Regular pulses provided by lateral eye movements isolate this vital light detecting mechanism from transient cues provided by the continuous play of light and shadow on the retina during waking. Light-modulated stimulation of the brain by REMs during paradoxical sleep also assures regular transmission of information concerning external light or darkness during sleep. Abnormalities of generation or rebound of paradoxical sleep associated with schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorders suggest a fundamental disturbance in regulation of this ancient light-modulated neuroendocrine axis

# Molecular basis of benzodiazepine actions 

## M. Karobath

After 20 years, during which the benzodiazepines have become the most commonly prescribed group of drugs, we are now gaining some detailed ideas as to how these minor tranquillizers are exerting their effects. Manfred Karobath summarizes the recent breakthroughs which have been made, indicating the influence of the benzodiazepines on GABA receptors, and how these studies brought to light the existence of an endogenous protein which normally occupies the receptors to which the benzodiazepines are attracted.

Benzodiazepines belong to the group of 'minor tranquillizers' and have become among the most frequently prescribed drugs since their introduction into clinical use in 1960 . They have potent antianxiety, anticonvulsive, muscle relaxant and, in higher doses, hypnotic effects, but exhibit low toxicity, and have virtually no peripheral side effects. Despite the use of benzodiazepines for almost two decades, only recently have indications for their mechanism of action been obtained with electrophysiological and biochemical methods. Electrophysiological investigations in a number of laboratories have provided evidence that the benzodiazepines potentiate the effects of $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an important neurotransmitter substance in the
CNS. This potentiation seems not to be caused by a direct GABA-agonistic effect of the benzodiazepines, since benzodiazepines are not able to mimic the effects of GABA in the absence of endogenous GABA, and they are only active in the presence of functional GABAergic transmission

## The benzodiazepine receptor

A direct biochemical approach for the study of drug actions was made possible by the introduction of ligand techniques which have been extensively used to identify and characterize high affinity binding sites for a large number of neurotransmitters, or of drugs affecting neurotransmitter systems. Such an approach has led to the discovery of
saturable and stereospecific binding sites with high affinity for benzodiazepines ${ }^{1,7}$. The very good correlation between the affinity of various benzodiazepines to these binding sites (ICso values) and their pharmacological potencies in animal and human test systems (Table I) provide strong evidence that these binding sites are the pharmacological benzodiazepine receptors ${ }^{1,7}$. These benzodiazepine receptors appear to be highly specific ${ }^{1,7}$, since a large number of psychoactive drugs and many neurotransmitter substances do not interfere with this high affinity binding of benzodiazepines. Up to now, no evidence for a heterogeneity of benzodiazepine receptors has been reported.

Benzodiazepine receptors have been found only in the brain, where they are unevenly distributed. Their concentration is highest in cortical areas, intermediate in the striatum and cerebellum, and low in the spinal cord, suggesting a predominantly cortical action of benzodiazepines ${ }^{1,7}$.

## Neuronal localization of the benzodiazepine receptor

Lesioning techniques with kainic acid, which selectively destroys neurones, but not glia, at the site of injection, have been used to demonstrate a neuronal localization of the benzodiazepine receptors. In the rat striatum, no significant change was found $10 \mathrm{~d}$ after lesioning with kainic acid $^{1}$, but after $30 \mathrm{~d}$ the number of benzodiazepine receptors decreased to $30 \%$ of control values (G. Sperk, personal communication). This slow decrease of benzodiazepine receptor binding compared with, for example, muscarinic receptor binding, which is already reduced $5 \mathrm{~d}$ after kainic acid injection. Benzodiazepine receptors and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent GABA binding, in contrast to muscarinic binding sites, are insensitive to treatment of synaptic membranes with low concentrations of Triton X-100. Benzodiazepine receptors thus appear to be tightly bound constituents of the junctional complex which has been shown to persist for several weeks after kainic acid lesions.

A similar reduction of benzodiazepine binding has been found in the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia of patients with Huntington's Chorea, a disease which is characterized by a selective degeneration of neurones in the basal ganglia ${ }^{2}$. Furthermore, the severe decrease of the number of benzodiazepine receptor sites in mutant mice which exhibit a selective degeneration of the cerebellar Purkinje cells points to a predominant association of benzodiazepine receptors with these neurones as wells. C-6 glioma cells also exhibit binding of benzodiazepines; however, this binding is pharmacologically different from the benzodiazepine receptor binding described above and corresponds with binding observed in peripheral tissues ${ }^{1}$. Summarizing these data, it appears that benzodiazepine receptors have a predominantly neuronal localization, although we do not know yet whether these receptors are localized in pre- and/or postsynaptic membranes.

## Interactions between benzodiazepine and GABA receptors

There is evidence for an effect of GABA on benzodiazepine receptors. Using extensively washed membranes, GABA and several GABA-like compounds in micromolar concentrations can activate the binding of benzodiazepines to their receptor by enhancing the affinity of the benzodiazepine binding site ${ }^{5,10}$. This GABA activation of benzodiazepine binding is antagonized by bicuculline, which blocks GABA receptors, but not by picrotoxin, which antagonizes the ionophore associated with the GABA receptor ${ }^{5,10}$. Further studies have shown that the GABA recognition site which is responsible for the activation of benzodiazepine binding has structural requirements that are different from those of the GABA receptor, which can be measured by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent $\mathrm{GABA}$ binding ${ }^{5}$. For example, the GABA agonists THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo ( 5,4 ) pyridin-3-ol) and isoguvacine (compounds which inhibit $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent GABA binding, and potentiate presynaptic inhibition in the spinal cord) do not activate the binding of benzodiazepines to their receptors. Surprisingly, THIP and isoguvacine exhibit properties of partial GABA agonists in this system; since they have been found to inhibit stimulation of benzodiazepine binding by low concentrations of GABA. Thus, it appears that a novel type, or different functional state, of the GABA receptor is associated with the benzodiazepine receptor.

There are also reports that benzodiazepines can modify the properties of the GABA receptor. An endogenous thermostable protein (about 15,000 daltons) has been described which binds to rat cortex membrane fractions and inactivates a $\mathrm{Na}^{*}$-independent high affinity binding site for $G A B A^{2}$. This protein has been purified approximately 500 -fold from rat brain. This endogenous protein, which is normally bound to synaptic membranes, has been proposed to be able to be displaced by benzodiazepines acting upon this protein's receptor". By such a mechanism, benzodiazepines may enhance the sensitivity of the GABA receptor for its transmitter, and thus may lead to the indirect potentiation of the GABA functions observed in electrophysiological experiments ${ }^{2}$. If this mechanism is responsible for the pharmacological effects of the benzodiazepines, then a correlation between the potency of the various benzodiazepines in displacing the endogenous modulator protein from brain membranes and their affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor should be found.

The endogenous thermostable protein inhibits benzodiazepine receptor binding. However, about 30 -fold higher concentrations than those necessary for inhibition of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent GABA binding are necessary for this inhibition. In this context, it is interesting that the purification of the modulatory protein followed a protocol ${ }^{2}$ which is very similar to that described for the purification of an endogenous inhibitor of cAMP and cGMP stimulated protein phosphorylation (type II inhibitor) which occurs in brain and peripheral tissues? . However, the modulatory protein has been reported to exert its inhibitory effects on GABA or benzodiazepine binding under nonphosphorylating conditions ${ }^{2}$.

The close connection between GABA and benzodiazepine receptors raises the question whether this functional association between the two receptors is mandatory, or whether these receptors can occur separately. At present, there is no evidence that benzodiazepine receptors may be associated with receptors other than those for GABA. However, GABA receptors may occur independently of benzodiazepine receptors. The data supporting this notion are indirect and not conclusive and may be summarized as follows: the regional distribution of benzodiazepine binding and of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$independent GABA binding differs since there is comparatively more GABA binding in the cerebellum ${ }^{1.4 .7}$.

Studies on the phylogenetic development of benzodiazepine receptors have shown that benzodiazepine receptors are 'recent' acquisitions of vertebrates', while GABA is already a transmitter in invertebrates. Finally, the different structural requirements for activation of benzodiazepine receptor binding and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent GABA binding as men-
tioned above may also be interpreted by suggesting a heterogeneity of GABA receptors in vertebrates ${ }^{5}$. Thus, different types of GABA receptors may exist, those linked to the benzodiazepine receptor, and others which are independent from benzodiazepine receptors. The latter may be different types of GABA receptors, or they could be 'floating' 'standard' GABA receptors which occur in the same membranes, but are not functionally coupled to benzodiazepine receptors.

Coupling of the benzodiazepine receptor to the GABA receptor ionophore

Anions may also modify benzodiazepine receptor binding. Chloride and several other anions, especially halides, enhance the binding of benzodiazepines to their receptor by enhancing the affinity to their binding site ${ }^{3}$. The selectivity of these effects of anions on benzodiazepine receptor binding has been suggested to be in agreement with their selectivity for their penetration through inhibitory postsynaptic membranes of cat motoneurones measured electrophysiologically ${ }^{3}$. These observations have led to the concept that benzodiazepine receptors are closely linked to the chloride conductance mechanism associated with the GABA receptor ${ }^{3}$. The fact that picrotoxin has no effect on GABA or benzodiazepine receptor binding suggests that the ionophore associated with the GABA receptor is a separate functional unit, which may be influenced by other types of drugs.

## Search for an endogenous ligand of benzodiazepine receptors

Just as the discovery of the morphine receptor led to the subsequent isolation of the endorphins, the discovery of benzodiazepine receptors suggested the existence of an endogenous ligand for these receptors. In the search for such an endogenous ligand, extracts from brain tissue were found to contain low molecular weight and heat stable compounds which resisted degradation by proteolytic enzymes and which were competitive inhibitors of benzodiazepine receptor binding ${ }^{5.8}$. In crude brain extracts the regional distribution of endogenous compounds which interfere with benzodiazepine binding is similar to that of benzodiazepine receptor binding sites in vivo and in vitros. Some of these compounds have been identified as hypoxanthine and inosine ${ }^{8}$.

However, the low affinity of hypoxanthine and inosine for benzodiazepine

receptors is difficult to reconcile with their putative role as endogenous ligands since brain concentrations of these substances are lower than those required to inhibit benzodiazepine binding, although they may be sufficiently high in some critical brain compartments. Furthermore, hypoxanthine and inosine levels might change significantly during stress or ischaemia. The pharmacological and behavioural effects of hypoxanthine and inosine are largely unexplored. Thus, until now, the search for an endogenous ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor has not yet let to the discovery of endogenous compounds which have potent agonistic or antagonistic effects compared with the benzodiazepines. In addition, the modulatory protein, which appears to desensitize the GABA receptor, also inhibits benzodiazepine receptor binding, although in higher concentrations ${ }^{2}$.

## Conclusions

There is now strong evidence that benzodiazepines exert their pharmacological effects in the CNS by interacting with a specific benzodiazepine receptor which is localized on neurones. This receptor appears to be part of a larger complex consisting of several sites including the benzodiazepine receptor, a GABA receptor, and the chloride conductance mechanism associated with the GABA receptor. A number of functional interactions between these sites have been described which seem to point to the concept of a more complex and modulated GABA receptor. The benzodiazepines appear to exert their pharmacological effects by altering the functional state of this benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex.
