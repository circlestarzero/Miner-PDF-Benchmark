## 课堂测验

## 测验题 1

Some people care much about their appearance and always ask if they look fine in they are wearing.
A that
B what
C how
D which

## 课堂测验

## 答案

B

## 解析

本题考查介词后的宾语从句。分析句子结构, in 为介词，其后的句子为宾语从句。 wear 为及物动词, 缺少宾语, that 在宾语从句中不充当成分, how 是连接副词, which 不能引导宾语从句, 均不符题意, 所以只能用 what 来引导宾语从句并在从句中作宾语。故正确答案为 B。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题 2

It's good to know $\qquad$ the dogs will be well cared for while we're away.
A what
B whose
C which
D that

## 课堂测验

## 答案

D

## 解析

本题考查主语从句。分析句子结构可知, It 在句中作形式主语, 真正主语是

" the dogs will be well cared for while we're away” 。主语从句中不缺成分, 所以用 that 来引导, that 在句中无语义。故正确答案为 $\mathrm{D}$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题 3

Before a problem can be solved, it must be obvious $\qquad$ the problem itself is.
A what
B that
C which
D why

## 课堂测验

A

## 解析

本题考查名词性从句。分析句子成分, 判断该句为主语从句, which 引导主语从句时意为 “在某一范围没选择” , 与句意不符, 排除C项; 又空格处在从句中充当宾语, 据此排除B、D项。该处使用 what 引导主语从句且在从句中充当宾语成分，符合题意，故正确答案为A。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题 4

You have to know ___ you're going if you are to plan the best way of getting there.
A what
B that
C where
D who

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

本题考查宾语从句。

分析句子成分可知, __you're going 作 know 的宾语, 为宾语从句。从句中缺少地点状语, 故应用 where 引导。故正确答案为C。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题 5

Exactly ____ the potato was introduced into Europe is uncertain, but it was probably around 1565 .
A whether
B why
C when
D how

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

本题主要考查主语从句。

分析句子结构可知, Exactly $\qquad$ the potato was introduced into Europe 为主语从句, 主语从句中结构完整, 引导词在从句中作状语, 由后面的 “大概在1565 年” 可知, 士豆引进欧洲的时间是不确定的，故应该使用表示时间的连接副词 when, 故正确答案为 $\mathrm{C}$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

- Must I go to the bank to pay the bill?
- No. You can do this ___ you are, either at the bank's ATM or using your PC or smart phone at home.

A whoever B whatever C wherever D whenever

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

本题考查地点状语从句。

分析句子结构可知, “You can do this” 主谓宾成分完整, “___you are”作其状语从句, 且由 “either at the bank's ATM or using your PC or smart phone at home" 可知从句中的引导词指代地点, 所以选用 wherever ( 无论什么地方），故正确答案为 $C$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

the job takes a significant amount of time, most students agree that the experience is worth it.
A If only
B After
C Although
D In case

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

本题考查状语从句引导词。

A项, If only “如果 $\cdots$ 就好了” ;

B项, After “在”之后”;

C项，Although “虽然，尽管”;

D项, In case “以防”。

结合句意可知, 这项工作花费了大量时间, 大多数学生都认同从中得到的经验值得这些时间。两个句子有让步关系, 故用 although 表 “虽然, 尽管”。故正确答案为

C。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

We should allow an extra hour to make the trip the traffic may be heavy.

A so that $B$ even though $C$ in case $D$ as if

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

本题考查状语从句和固定搭配。

分析句子结构可知，该空前后为两个分句，且空格之前为主句，空格之后为状语从句。

A项, so that “以便，所以” , 引导目的状语从句;

B项, even though “即使”，引导让步状语从句;

C项，in case “以防”，引导条件状语从句;

D项, as if “好像”，常用于虚拟语气中，或在状语从句中表示方式。

结合语境，空格之后的状语从句意为 “以防交通拥堵”，表示主句 “我们应该为这个行程多预留一个小时” 的条件。故正确答案为 C。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

They've moved to a different house $\qquad$ their children can attend a better school.
A in case
B as long as
C so that
D even though

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

本题考查状语从句及语义辨析。

A项, in case “万一" ;

B项, as long as “只要” ;

C项, so that “为了, 目的是” ;

D项, even though “即使” 。

根据句意 “他们已经搬去了其他地方,他们的孩子可以上更好的学校” , 只有 $C$ 项符合句意, 故正确答案为 $C$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

It may be worth trying ___ the effort makes you uncomfortable.

A even if $B$ as though $C$ in case $D$ now that

## 课堂测验

## 答案

A

## 解析

本题考查状语从句引导词的使用。

A项, “即使”，引导让步状语从句;

B项，“似乎，好像”，可用于虚拟语气;

C项, “万一, 假使”，引导让步状语从句;

D项, “既然”, 引导原因状语从句。

即使（even if）努力并不舒服，但仍值得试试，even if 符合题意，其余三项均不符

合。故正确答案为 $A$ 。



## Reading

$\square$ Topic: Social Media



## Social Media

(1) Enough "meaningless drivel". That's the message from a group of members of the UK government who have been examining how social media firms like LinkedIn gather and use social media data.

(2) The House of Commons Science and Technology Committee's(下议院科学技术委员会) report, released(释放；发布) last week, has blamed firms for making people sign up to long incomprehensible(难懂的) legal contracts and calls for(呼吁) an international standard or kitemark(认证标记) to identify sites that have clear terms and conditions(条款).

(3) "The term and conditions statement that we all carelessly agree to is meaningless drivel to anyone," says Andrew Miller, the chair of the committee. Instead, he says, firms should provide a plain(清楚的)-English version of their terms. The simplified(简化的) version would be checked by a third party and awarded a kitemark if it is an accurate(准确的) reflection of



## Social Media

(4) It is not yet clear who would administer(管理) the scheme(计划), but the UK government is looking at introducing it on a voluntary basis. "we need to think through how we make that work in practice," says Miller.

(5) Would we pay any more attention to a kitemark? "I think if you went and did the survey, people would like to think they would," says Nigel Shadbolt at the University of Southampton, UK, who studies open data. "We do know people worry a lot about the inappropriate(不恰当的) use of their information." But what would happen in practice is another matter, he says.

(6) Other organisations such as banks ask customers to sign long contracts they may not read or understand, but Miller believes social media requires special attention because it is so new. "We still don't know how significant the long-term impact is going to be of unwise things that kids put on social media that come back and bite them in 20 years' time," he says.

## Social Media

(7) Shadbolt, who gave evidence to the committee, says the problem is that we don't know how companies will use our data because their business models and uses of data are still evolving(发展). Large collections of personal information have become valuable only recently, he says.

(8) The shock and anger when a social media firm does something with data that people don't expect, even if users have apparently permission, show that the current situation isn't working. If properly administered, a kitemark on terms and conditions could help people know what exactly they are signing up to. Although they would still have to actually read them. (16 上海卷C)
