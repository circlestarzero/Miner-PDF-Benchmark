Cycloartenol synthase converts oxidosqualene to the pentacyclic sterol precursor cycloartenol. An Arabidopsis thaliana cycloartenol synthase Ile481Val mutant was previously shown to produce lanosterol and parkeol in addition to its native product cycloartenol. Experiments are described here to construct Phe, Leu, Ala, and Gly mutants at position 481 and to determine their cyclization product profiles. The Phe mutant was inactive, and the Leu mutant produced cycloartenol and parkeol. The Ala and Gly mutants formed lanosterol, cycloartenol, parkeol, achilleol A, and camelliol $\mathrm{C}$. Monocycles comprise most of the Gly mutant product, showing that an alternate cyclization route can be made the major pathway by a single nonpolar mutation.

Terpene synthases catalyze cationic cyclization and rearrangement reactions that convert acarbocyclic precursors to carbocyclic products. Four enzyme families provide hundreds of terpene hydrocarbon structures: the higher plant TPS enzymes (which form monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and diterpenes), ${ }^{1}$ fungal ${ }^{2}$ sesquiterpene synthases, bacterial sesquiterpene synthases, ${ }^{3}$ and a prokaryotic and eukaryotic

The AtCAS1 cDNA was subjected to oligo-directed mutagenesis in vector pRS305GAL. ${ }^{12}$ The mutants were subcloned into the high-copy yeast expression vector pRS426GAL ${ }^{11}$ and expressed in the yeast strain LHY2, from which both squalene synthase and lanosterol synthase had been deleted. ${ }^{11}$ Typically, cells from 1-L cultures prepared as described ${ }^{13}$ were suspended in $100 \mathrm{mM}$ sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.4 and lysed in a French Press. Racemic oxidosqualene was added to $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ from a $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$ solution in $20 \%$ Triton X-100. The reaction was quenched after $24 \mathrm{~h}$, and triterpene alcohol products were isolated as described. ${ }^{14}$

Reactions were monitored by TLC (silica gel, 1:1 hexane/ ether), and products were acetylated (acetic anhydride/ pyridine) and identified by GC, GC/MS, and ${ }^{1} \mathrm{H}$, and/or ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ NMR. AtCAS1 Ile481Phe was inactive, but the remaining mutants metabolized oxidosqualene. The AtCAS1Ile481Leu products were indistinguishable from cycloartenol by TLC,

GC and GC/MS analyses of the acetylated Ile481Ala and Ile481Gly products also revealed cycloartenol, lanosterol, and parkeol. However, two additional compounds were observed to have the appropriate mass for triterpenyl acetates.

The products (percent composition determined by GC) of these enzymes are summarized in Table 1. Even minor steric changes at position 481 impair cycloartenol production. Forming the strained cyclopropane ring is apparently readily compromised. Mutating Ile481 to Leu maintains total steric bulk but shifts a methyl group from the $\beta$ - to the $\gamma$-carbon. This isomeric side chain allows deprotonation from C-11 to yield parkeol, but only minimal deprotonation from C-9 or C-8 to form lanosterol. In contrast, mutating to the methyl side chain (Ile481Ala) generates an enzyme that forms lanosterol as its major product. Furthermore, Ala promotes ring B formation less efficiently than Ile, Leu, or Val. The monocyclic cation can deprotonate to either achilleol A or camelliol C. Ile481Gly forms primarily monocycles, and the ratio of achilleol A to camelliol C formation increases relative to that of the Ile481Ala products.

S. cerevisiae lanosterol synthase (ScERG7) mutants were recently described in which Val454 (which corresponds to AtCAS1 Leu481) was mutated to Phe, Leu, Ile, Ala, and Gly. ${ }^{14}$ Like AtCAS1, ScERG7 lost activity upon mutating the target residue to Phe. The ScERG7 Val454 Leu and Ile mutants remained accurate lanosterol synthases. The Ala and Gly mutants were lanosterol synthases that also produced achilleol A (5\% and 12\%, respectively). Decreasing steric bulk at ScERG7 position 454 compromised ring B formation, although to a lesser extent than at the analogous AtCAS1 position 481. Moreover, ScERG7Val454 mutants did not form measurable amounts of the alternative deprotonation

Lanosterol synthase is evidently less sensitive than cycloartenol synthase to steric alterations at this position. Perhaps less precise positioning of active site electron density and steric bulk is required to form the energetically favorable tetrasubstituted olefin than to close the strained cyclopropane ring.

These experiments establish that cycloartenol synthase can be mutated to make different tetracyclic or monocyclic compounds in high yield. The mutants described herein may mimic naturally occurring enzymes. Achilleol A and camelliol $\mathrm{C}$ have been isolated from plants, but the enzymes that catalyze their formation remain undiscovered. Several organisms ${ }^{20}$ produce achilleol A without camelliol C, as do the ScERG7 Val454 Ala and Gly mutants. Sasanqua oil ${ }^{21}$ contains camelliol $\mathrm{C}$ and achilleol $\mathrm{A}$, as in the products of AtCAS1 Ile481 Ala and Gly mutants. None of these mutants produced camelliol C without achilleol A, and similarly, camelliol $\mathrm{C}$ has never been isolated from a natural source unaccompanied by achilleol $\mathrm{A}$. It is tempting to speculate that camelliol $\mathrm{C}$ may be produced in nature by a cycloartenol synthase Ile481 Ala or Gly mutant, and achilleol A from a similar mutant of a different oxidosqualene cyclase.
