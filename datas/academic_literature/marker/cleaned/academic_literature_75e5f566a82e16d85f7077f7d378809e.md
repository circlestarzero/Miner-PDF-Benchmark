Abstract—Site substitution of ternary elements in ordered compounds influences the electronic structure and hence the properties of compounds at the continuous level. The electronic structure and binding energy of a number of NiAl-X alloy systems (X=Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Si, Ga, or Ge) were calculated using the discrete variational cluster method based on the local density approximation of the density functional theory. The site preference of the ternary additions to NiAl was investigated by employing the Bragg–Williams model to analyse the calculated binding energy. The results show that all the considered ternary elements possess stronger preference to the Al sublattice sites than a Ni atom does. A new method of identifying sublattice substitution of ternary additions in NiAl was proposed by comparison of the binding energies per atom of the ternary and the binary clusters involving the fourth nearest neighbours. The analysis suggests that Fe and Co atoms occupy the Ni sublattice sites, whereas Si, Ga and Ti atoms occupy the Al sublattice sites. The remaining elements may substitute for both sublattices: Mn is most likely to go for the Ni sublattice; V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W and Ge have a larger preference for the Al sublattice, but Cr and W do not show significant preference to any sublattice. The densities of states involving alloying additions of Co, Si and Cr were further investigated to clarify the site preference of the alloying additions.  2001 Acta Materialia Inc.

## 1. Introduction

Intermetallic compound NiAl has been under popular interest in recent years for potential use as high-temperature, weight-saving structural materials. A major factor limiting many of their applications is the lack of sufficient room temperature ductility. Successful attempts to improve the ductility of the compound often involve the addition of ternary or high-order elements. The additions can be either interstitial or substitutional in nature and the site occupancy of these substitutional additions considerably influences the mechanical properties of the compounds [1].

Understanding of microalloying effects requires a knowledge of sublattice occupancy of ternary elements. The site preference of alloying additions has been investigated extensively by means of various experimental techniques [2–6]. Although providing valuable evidence of the substitution behaviour of ternary elements, the experimental data are still not fully or not readily available. Theoretical studies of the site preference of selected ternary additions in NiAl have been carried out using the Bozzolo–Ferrante–Smith (BFS) method [7] based on the quantum perturbation theory, the first principles calculations [8, 9] and the Bragg–Williams model using thermodynamic data
[10, 11].

In the BFS model the energy of formation is written as the superposition of elemental contributions of all the atoms in an alloy, and partitioned into two parts: a strain energy, which relates to the atomic positions of the neighbour atoms, and a chemical energy contribution. Both the strain energy and the chemical energy were evaluated as isolated effects with the so called equivalent crystal theory [12]. The influence of the geometrical distribution of the surrounding atoms in relation to the chemical effects was described by introducing a coupling function in the BFS model.

The site preference of the ternary alloying additions was then determined by comparing the energy of formation of each computational cell [7].

The site preference of the ternary additions in NiAl was also investigated through the calculations of the total and formation energies using the first principles linear muffin-tin orbital method within the atomic sphere approximation [8]. The site preference energy was defined as the difference between the formation energies of ternary alloys with the alloying atom on different sublattices. Calculation of the enthalpy of NiAl-X systems was performed by Fu and Zou [9]
using the full-potential linearised augmented planewave method at the dilute approximation (i.e. the interactions between the ternary additions were ignored). The enthalpy of the NiAl-X systems was expressed as a function of the total energy of a perfect NiAl crystal, the concentration and the formation energies of vacancies, antisite defects and the ternary element, and their chemical potentials. The formation energies at lattice sites are dependent on the departure from stoichiometry due to the compositional dependence of chemical potentials in this model. It can be used to study the dependence of site preference on the concentration of the ternary addition.

In this paper, a new approach is devised for clear determination of the substitution behaviour of selected ternary elements in NiAl using a first principles discrete variational cluster method. The binding energy and the electronic structure of the ternary NiAl-X systems were first calculated. Site preference of the ternary additions in NiAl was evaluated by combining the binding energies with the Bragg–Williams model. The alloying elements X include Ti, V,
Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Si, Ga, and Ge. The predictions are compared with experimental findings and the results of available theoretical treatments.

## 2. Method Of Calculation And Analysis 2.1. Total Energy And Binding Energy

Calculations of electronic structures and binding energies were performed for selected NiAl-X systems using the discrete variational cluster method (DVM)
[13]. The DVM is based on the density functional theory, in which the total energy of a system is expressed as a function of the electron density and the type and arrangements of the atomic nuclei:

$$E_{t o t}=E_{t o t}[\rho(\mathbf{r}),\{\mathbf{R}_{\alpha}\}]$$
Etot = *Etot*[r(r),{Ra}] (1)
where r(r) is the electron density at point r in real space, and the set {Ra} denotes the positions of all atoms a in the system under consideration. The electron density was expressed as:

$$\rho(\mathbf{r})=\sum f_{i}|\psi_{i}|^{2}$$

2 (2)
where yi is the wave function of the ith molecular orbital and expressed as the linear combination of atomic orbitals, and fi is the number of electrons occupying the ith molecular orbital. The variational principle, multi-dimension Diophantus numerical integral method [13], and the self-consistent charge approximation were used to solve the Kohn–Sham equation and then to estimate the total energy. The convergence criterion was chosen as such that the difference between two consecutive values of the charge selfconsistent integration is less than 104. The Hedin and Lundquist exchange-correlation potential [14] was used here.

In order to describe the bonding properties of an alloying atom with matrix atoms, the binding energy per atom of the considered system containing N atoms is defined as the difference between the total energy Etot and the sum of the energies of the constituent atoms, i.e.,

$$E_{b}=\frac{1}{N}(E_{tot}-\sum_{a}^{N}E_{a\alpha\alpha}^{\alpha})\tag{3}$$

where Eaatom is the energy of the constituent atom a.

2.2. Prediction of site preference of ternary additions based on the Bragg–Williams model NiAl possesses a B2 structure, in which one type of atom occupies the body-centred position (a sublattice) while the other occupies the corner positions (b sublattice) of the cubic unit cell. At a given absolute temperature, pressure, and overall composition, the total Gibbs energy G of the considered system can be expressed as a function of three variables, ya, yb, and z [11]:

$$(4)$$
$$G=G(y^{\alpha},y^{\beta},z)$$
G = G(ya,yb,z) (4)
where ya, yb, and z were defined as

ya = NaX NaX + NaA(5) yb = NbX NbX + NbA(6) z = NaVac N (7)
 (5)  $$\begin{array}{l}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\end{array}$$ (6)  $$\begin{array}{l}~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\end{array}$$ (7)  . 
$\mathrm{f}$. 
$$(2)$$
Here, the parameters NaX and NbX denote the number of X atoms on the a- and b- sublattices, respectively; z is the concentration of vacancy, given by the number of vacancies, NaVac, divided by the total number of lattice sites, N.

The equilibrium defect concentrations and the distribution of the alloying atom at a specific temperature, pressure and overall composition can be obtained by minimizing G with respect to the three variables ya, yb and z. Based on the Bragg–Williams model, Kao *et al*. [11] obtained the following relationship for the dilute approximation:

$${\frac{(1-y^{\alpha})y^{\beta}}{(1-y^{\beta})y^{\alpha}}}=\exp\!\left({\frac{2k}{k T}}\right)\qquad\qquad(8)$$

where

$$K=4(H_{A A}-H_{A X}-H_{A B}+H_{B X})$$

Here, Hij is the interaction enthalpy of the nearest neighbour pairs i and j.

The site preference of ternary additions in NiAl can be estimated from equations (8) and (9), if the interaction parameters Hij are determined. For K>0, from equation (8), yb>ya, which indicates that the X atoms have a stronger preference for the b-sublattice sites than the A atoms. On the other hand, for K-0, then yb-ya, implying that the alloying atoms have a stronger preference for the a-sublattice sites than the A atoms. For K = 0, then yb = ya; this suggests that A and X have the same preference for the b-sublattice sites. As pointed out by Kao *et al*. [11], the sign of K determines the *relative* site preference of A and X
atoms, but does not determine the absolute site preference of X atoms (the number of X atoms on the asublattice relative to those on the b-sublattice).

Introducing equations (5) and (6) into equation (8),
we obtain

$${\frac{N_{A}^{\alpha}\,N_{X}^{\beta}}{N_{A}^{\beta}\,N_{X}^{\alpha}}}=\exp\!\left({\frac{2K}{k T}}\right)$$
kT (10)
Note that NaA is always much larger than NbA, so for K0, from equation (10), NaXNbX, i.e., there are many more X atoms on the a-sublattice than on the b-sublattice, though, in the case of K = 0, both A and X atoms have identical preference for either the a or the b sublattice. The case of K>0 is more complicated, and a definite conclusion cannot be drawn directly from equation (10) on the ratio of NaX over NbX.

2.3. Estimation of Hij *from the first principles calculations of binding energy Eb* In principle, the parameters Hij in equation (9) can be estimated from binary thermodynamic data, vacancy formation energies in pure metals, defect concentrations and other material properties [11]. However, many of such data are unavailable in the literature. It is thus desirable to estimate the values of the Hij from first principles calculation. The present authors have devised a model for estimating these parameters from the binding energy values obtained from first principles calculations, and used this model to study the substitution behaviour of ternary elements in TiAl [15]. The total binding energy of the considered system can be expressed as the sum of the energies between the nearest neighbour interaction pairs,

$\begin{array}{c}\mbox{\rm NE}_{b}(X,A/B)=\mbox{\rm\small$\sum$}E_{ij}\\ \mbox{\rm\small$\sum$}E_{ij}\end{array}$ (11)
where Eb(X, A/B) denotes the binding energy per

$\mathrm{(l)}$
atom of the system when the alloying atom X substitutes for the A or the B atom.

The interaction energy, Eij, on the right-hand side of equation (11) can be used to represent the interaction enthalpy Hij. Expanding the sum of the righthand side of equation (11) over a unit cell (an atomic cluster containing N = 9 atoms for the B2 compound), we obtained:
For the case of X substituting for an A atom,

$$(12)$$
$$N^{\prime}E_{b}(X,A)=8H_{X B}^{(1)}+F(B)$$
XB + F(B) (12)
and for the case of X substituting for a B atom

$$N^{\prime}E_{b}(X,B)=8H_{X A}^{(1)}+F(A)$$
$$(13)$$
XA + F(A) (13)
Here F(A) and F(B) are the energy sums of the highorder interaction pairs beyond the first nearest neighbours. Considering the atomic configuration of the B2 lattice and ignoring the influence of the alloying atom X, we can define the high-order interaction energy as F(Y) = 12H(2)
YY + 12H(3)
YY + 4H(4)
YY (14)

$$(10)$$

where Y represents either A or B. The superscripts 1, 2, 3, and 4 in equations (12) to (14) denote the first, second, third and fourth nearest neighbour interactions, respectively.

For the stoichiometry (X = A or B in equation (12)
or (13)), and the anti-site defect (X = B or A in equation (12) or (13)) cases, we obtain from equations
(12) and (13)

$$[H_{B B}^{(1)}-H_{A B}^{(1)}]=\frac{N^{\prime}}{8}[E_{b}(B,A)-E_{b}(A,A)]$$  $$[H_{A A}^{(1)}-H_{A B}^{(1)}]=\frac{N^{\prime}}{8}[E_{b}(A,B)-E_{b}(B,B)]$$
$$(15)$$
$$(16)$$
$$F(B)-F(A)=N^{\prime}[E_{b}(A,A)-E_{b}(B,B)]$$
$$(17)$$

From equations (12), (13) and (17), the following equation can be obtained:

$$\begin{array}{c}{{[H_{x B}^{(1)}-H_{x A}^{(1)}]=\frac{N^{\prime}}{8}\{[E_{b}(X,A)-E_{b}(A,A)]\}}}\\ {{-[E_{b}(X,B)-E_{b}(B,B)]\}}\end{array}$$
$$(18)$$

Substituting equations (16) and (18) into equation (9)
leads to an expression of the parameter K as a function of the binding energy Eb:

$\begin{array}{l}\mbox{\rm K}=\mbox{\rm K}^{\prime}\\ \mbox{\rm K}=\mbox{\rm K}^{\prime}\mbox{\rm K}(\mbox{\rm K},\mbox{\rm A})-\mbox{\rm E}_{\rm B}(\mbox{\rm A},\mbox{\rm A})\end{array}$
$$(19)$$
With the aid of equations (8) and (19), it is now possible to evaluate much precisely the site substitution behaviour of the ternary additions in NiAl from the binding energy data obtained from first principles calculations.

## 3. Results And Discussion 3.1. Binding Energy And Formation Energy

In a previous study [16], it has been noted that the influence of the atomic interactions beyond the third nearest neighbours on the binding energy is very weak for bcc transition metals. Nevertheless, the cluster used here included the fourth nearest neighbours in order to further increase the accuracy of the calculated electronic structure and the binding energy of NiAl-X systems. The Ni or Al atom at the centre of the clusters was replaced by an alloying atom X to simulate the case of the X atom occupying a Ni (Fig.

1 (a)) or an Al (Fig. 1 (b)) sublattice site in a real alloy. The cases of anti-site defects were also treated using this approach: a Ni atom occupies an Al site
(X = Ni in Fig. 1 (b)) or an Al atom occupies a Ni site (X = Al in Fig. 1 (a)). Although anti-site defects may not be present for some off-stoichiometric compositions of NiAl, it is necessary to consider such hypothetic defect configurations in order to address thoroughly the site preference issue of ternary additions. The investigation of Medvedeva *et al*. [8],
by means of the LMTO calculation, showed that the lattice relaxation around solute atoms in NiAl is not sufficiently large to affect their site preference. So the effect due to the lattice relaxation was not considered in the present calculations.

The calculated binding energies and the values of the site preference parameter K for the investigated elements are listed in Table 1. It is noted that all elements in Table 1 exhibit positive values of K, suggesting that these ternary additions have stronger preference for the Al sublattice than Ni atoms. Of the elements considered, Si, Ga and Ge atoms have similar valence electron structures to Al and, as expected, have a higher tendency to occupy the Al sublattice than Ni atoms. The transition metals Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta and W also have stronger tendencies to occupy the Al sublattice than the Ni atoms. In other words, Ni atoms have a very weak tendency to go to the Al sublattice: this deduction is consistent with the experimental fact that structural vacancies on the Al sublattice dominate the defect structure in Ni-rich NiAl. The values of K calculated from the Bragg–
Williams model based on the thermodynamic data are also positive for dilute additions of Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Co [11]. This agrees with the present results.

The calculated formation energies from the BFS
model for the configurations of a) an alloying atom occupying an Al site, and b) an alloying atom occupying a Ni site with the Ni atom on an available Al site, showed that the gap of the formation energies between the two configurations varies with the type of alloying atoms [7]. It has been found that, for Si, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Cu, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, and W, the configuration of the alloying atom occupying an Al site has a lower formation energy than the other case. This indicates that it is energetically favourable for these alloying elements to occupy the Al sites. For Co addition to NiAl, the situation is exactly the opposite. The present calculations showed that the value of K for Co addition to NiAl is the lowest among the elements considered here, which indicates that Co is least likely to occupy the Al site.

By comparing the site preference energies, Medvedeva *et al*. [8] concluded that La, Zr, Mo, V and Cr must occupy the Al sublattice in NiAl, and for the series of transition metals, the site preference energy decreases from Ti to V, Cr and Mn. The present prediction of the site preference of these elements agrees with the results of Medvedeva *et al*. [8]; the order of the site preference energy determined by these authors is in agreement with the relative magnitude of the K parameter obtained in the present work (see Table 1).

3.2. Site preference of alloying additions As mentioned by Kao *et al*. [11], it is rather difficult to predict the absolute site preference of an alloying atom in NiAl in the case K>0. One possible

solution might be to calculate the value of NaA/NbA



using a thermodynamic model, and then determine the value of NaX/NbX through equation (10). Here, we present a method of predicting the absolute site preference of alloying additions in NiAl starting from binding energy calculations. The approach is based on the principle that the equilibrium distribution of alloying atoms between the sublattices should minimize the binding energy per atom of the system. The choice of sublattice by a foreign species in NiAl can then be evaluated by comparison of the system energies between the two cases of site substitutions by an alloying species. Figure 2 shows a diagram designed to illustrate the above idea: the abscissa, E(Ni), represents the difference in binding energies between the ternary NiAl-X (X substitutes for Ni sublattice) and the binary NiAl systems; the ordinate, E(Al), is a quantity similar to E(Ni), but for the case of Al sublattice substitution. A positive value of E(Al) (or E(Ni)) means that the Al (or Ni) sublattice substitution of the alloying atom is energetically unfavourable and will not occur. In the case of both E(Al)
and E(Ni) being negative, the alloying atom is judged to choose a sublattice which results in a greater reduction in the system energy. In Fig. 2, the horizontal and vertical lines passing through the positions of Al and Ni, respectively, conveniently divide the diagram into four regions. It is clearly shown that Fe and Co atoms occupy the Ni sublattice sites only, while Si, Ga and Ti only replace atoms on the Al sublattice. The sublattice substitution behaviour of the remaining elements can be classified with respect to the dotted line in the bottom-left region in Fig. 2: Mn has a higher concentration on the Ni sublattice than on the Al sublattice; Cr and W partition more or less equally to both sublattices, whereas Ge, V, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf and Ta have a larger atomic fraction on the Al than on the Ni sublattice.

For comparison, it is appropriate to recall the predictions of other relevant theoretical investigations and earlier experimental findings. Studies employing the BFS model [7] have shown that Co atoms occupy the Ni sites, while Si, Cr, Zr, Hf, Ti, V, Nb, Mo, Ta and W substitute for the Al sites. Fe atoms go to both the Al and the Ni sublattices, but with preference for the Ni sites. The first principles LMTO calculations
[8] showed that Zr, Mo, Ti, V and Cr additions prefer the Al sublattice, whereas Fe prefers the Ni sublattice.

X-ray diffraction experiments found that Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta and W atoms occupy the Al sites, while Fe and Co atoms occupy both the Al and the Ni sites, but with preference for the Ni sites [2]. Compared with these investigations, the present work predicts a stronger tendency for Fe to occupy the Ni sub-



lattice, and singles out Ti to have the strongest tendency on the Al sublattice among all the Al-substituting elements. Very recently, Terada *et al*. [17] used an empirical approach based on the locus of thermal conductivity contours in the β-NiAl phase field to assess the site preference of alloying elements in NiAl. These authors suggested that V, Nb, Ta, Mo, Fe, Ru, Co and Pt substitute preferentially for Ni in NiAl; Ti, Mn, Ga, Si and Ge substitute preferentially for Al; and Cr and Cu substitute equally for both Ni and Al sites. It should be noted, however, that the physical basis of this experimental approach to site preference determination has not been fully justified. Table 2 compares the results of the site preferences of ternary additions from the present study, some experimental findings, and other theoretical methods.

3.3. Physical explanation of site preference In order to probe into the physical origin of sublattice selection of alloying atoms in NiAl, the density of states (DOS) of valence electrons were examined.

With the aid of Fig. 2, Si, Co and Cr were selected to represent the typical cases of site substitutions. Figures 3 to 5 show the partial DOSs of the valence electrons of the central atoms for the NiAl-X (X=Si, Cr or Co) atomic clusters, respectively. Figure 3 compares the DOSs of the valence electrons of Si when it substitutes for an Al (solid line) and a Ni (dash line) site. For the case of Al site substitution, there are four bonding peaks below the Fermi level, at about 0.4 eV, 2.5 eV, 5.0 eV and 7.0 eV. For the other case, there are also four bonding peaks below the Fermi level at about 0.0 eV, 1.5 eV, 4.8 eV and 8.2 eV. Although showing relatively high peaks around 0.02.0 eV just below the Fermi level, the former case gives rise to considerably low peaks around 4.0 eV9.0 eV below the Fermi energy (Fig. 3). This indicates that the bonds are stronger when Si occupies the Al sublattice, resulting in a more stable state than the opposite case of Ni substitution. For the addition of Cr (Fig. 4), the bonding peaks exist at the Fermi energy level and at about 2.5 eV and 4.0 eV when it substitutes an Al site, and those are at the Fermi energy level and at about 1.5 eV and 4.5 eV when it occupies a Ni site. It is noted that the partial DOSs of the main peaks at the Fermi level are similar between the two cases of substitutes. Because the other peaks below the Fermi level show opposite variations for the cases of substitutions, their overall contributions to bond strength are likely to be similar. Therefore Cr may substitute for either sites without significant preference. Figure 5 presents the partial DOSs for alloying with Co. The bonding peaks are at about 0.5 eV, 2.2 eV and 3.8 eV when Co substitutes for a Ni site. On the other hand, only one main bonding peak is present near 0.5 eV (and a much weaker one at 4.5 eV)
when it is at an Al site. The amplitude of the main peak in the latter case is lower than that of the former case. In addition, the other peaks in the former case are also relatively strong. The results clearly imply that Co shows strong preference to the Ni sites in NiAl. The above observations show that the site preference of ternary additions in NiAl is determined by the electronic structure of the system.

## 4. Conclusions

The electronic structure and the binding energy of ternary NiAl-X (X=Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Si, Ga or Ge) systems have been calculated by means of the first principles discrete variational cluster method. Using the binding energy as an interaction bond parameter, a method has been devised for clear determination and classification of the sublattice preference of ternary additions in NiAl within the framework of the Bragg–Williams model.

The main findings are as follows.

All the alloying elements considered show stronger preference for the Al sublattice than Ni atoms, but the absolute site occupancy, the number of alloying atoms on the Ni sublattice relative to that on the Al sublattice, can not be directly determined from the Bragg–Williams model because all the alloying elements considered have positive values of the site preference parameter K.

The sublattice preference of the alloying atoms in NiAl was further clarified by comparing the binding energy of the system in the two cases of the alloying atoms occupying the Ni or the Al sites. Fe and Co were found to substitute for Ni, whereas Si, Ga and Ti substitute for Al. Other elements, V, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W and Ge, have mixed substitution of both the Ni and Al sublattices. Of these Mn is predicted to have a larger atomic fraction on the Ni sublattice; the other elements are mainly on the Al sublattice, though for Cr and W the difference in site occupancies on the two sublattices is very small. The densities of states of valence electrons of NiAl alloyed with Si, Cr and Co were calculated, and the bonding characteristics as observed on the DOS curves can be successfully used to interpret the distinct substitution behaviour of these elements in NiAl.
