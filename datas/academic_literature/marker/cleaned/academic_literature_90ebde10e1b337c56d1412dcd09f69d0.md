## Abstract

Mass-energy distributions (MEDs) and capture-fission cross sections have been measured in the reaction 48 Ca 4 208 Pb → 256 No at the energies E 1ab = 206–242 MeV using a double-arm time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET. It has been observed that MED of the fragments consists of two parts, namely, the classical fusion–fission process corresponding to the symmetric fission of 256 No and quasi-fission "shoulders" corresponding to the light fragment masses w 60–90 u and complimentary heavy fragment masses. The quasi-fission "shoulders" have a higher total kinetic energy (TKE) as compared with that expected for the classical fission. A mathematical formalism was employed for the MEDs fragment decomposition into fusion–fission and quasi-fission components. In the fusion–fission process a high-energy Super-Short mode has been discovered for the masses M H = 130–135 u and the TKE of ≈ 233 MeV. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

## 1. Introduction

Good results were achieved in the past few years in the experiments on the synthesis of superheavy elements (SHE). The new isotopes of the nuclei with Z = 102–118 were produced in the reactions with heavy ions [1–3]. However, significant obstruction to the fusion of heavy nuclei and the formation of superheavy nucleus is the quasi-fission process [4–8]. Quasi-fission is a fully damped process in which in contrast to the true fusion–fission the interacting nuclei cannot form a completely fused system inside the fission barrier.

The study of characteristic features of the fusion–fission (FF) and quasi-fission (QF) processes and their relative contribution into the capture cross section allows one to obtain the information about the dynamics of collision, coalescence and decay of the composite nucleus. The ratio of the FF and QF cross sections depends on different properties of the reaction entrance channel such as charges Zp, Zt , masses Ap, At , deformations and orientations of colliding nuclei, the introduced energy and angular momentum. It is known that in the reactions with deformed targets different orientations of the colliding nuclei (prolate and oblate) are possible in the entrance channel, and the prolate configuration is favorable for the quasi-fission process, whereas the oblate configuration leads to the formation of the compound nucleus (CN) [9].

The studied reaction 48Ca + 208Pb occupies a special place among the 48Ca-induced reactions leading to the formation of superheavy nuclei. In contrast to the reactions with deformed targets, only a compact configuration between magic spherical nuclei is possible in the entrance channel of the above-mentioned reaction. As expected, it leads to the true fusion and decreases the QF
contribution into the capture cross section. The nuclear structure effects from rotations and vibrations are minimal for these doubly magic spherical interacting nuclei which also has to influence the evolution of the composite system into the compact shape of a compound nucleus. Really the minimal QF contribution to the capture cross section was observed here in the production of elements with Z = 82–116 [8] in the reactions with 48Ca ions.

Due to the doubly magic structure of the target and projectile the excitation energy of the compound nucleus at the Coulomb barrier calculated according to the Bass model [10] is E∗*(BC)* = 22.3 MeV. This circumstance allows us to study the properties of the FF/QF processes near and below the Coulomb barrier at quite a low excitation energy.

As for the properties of the true fission process of superheavy elements, today it is well known that MEDs of fission fragments have a bimodal nature in the spontaneous fission [11–13] in the Fm–Rf region of the nuclei chart. Bimodality means the co-existence of two different types (modes) of fission with special mass (symmetric or asymmetric shapes) and TKE characteristics in the same nucleus. It deals with the valley structure of the Potential Energy Landscape of a fissioning nucleus due to shell effects. The contribution of various modes can be very different in the neighboring nuclei and isotopes. For example, the comparison of mass distributions in the spontaneous fission of Fm (Z = 100) and No (Z = 102) isotope chains shows that a sharp transition from a standard two-humped mass distribution (MD) to a prominent narrow symmetric one occurs with a change in the neutron number in the fissioning nucleus from 157 to 158 in the case of Fm [13] and from 154 to 156 in the case of No chains [14].

At moderate excitation energies (E∗ = 10–20 MeV) shell effects begin to fade away, however the modal structure is still observed. In the reaction of the superheavy nuclei production the excitation energy of nuclei at the Coulomb barrier is usually ≈ 10–20 MeV for "cold" fusion and
≈ 40–50 MeV for "hot" fusion [3] reactions. In this work we measured the MED of fragments of the reaction 48Ca + 208Pb at excitation energies from 17.6 MeV till 41 MeV.

Theoretical calculations made for the superheavy nuclei show that at the potential energy surface in the multidimensional deformation space of fissioning nuclei there exist at least two
[15–17] or even three [18,19] fission valleys. One of the valleys, named by Brosa et al. the SuperShort (SS) valley [16] is connected with a possibility for these nuclei to have in both fragments the number of neutrons and protons close to magic numbers N = 82 and Z = 50. This possibility will fast disappear at moving from Fm to more heavy nuclei. However, the calculations show
[15,17,19] that the SS-valley should exist with the superheavy nuclei up to 270,272Hs (Z = 108)
and even 278110 [15] and 290110 [19]. In this work we studied the modal structure in the fragment MEDs of 256No at low and moderate excitation energies.

The reaction 48Ca + 208Pb was studied earlier in several works: the capture-fission cross sections were measured in [4,20,21] the fragment MEDs in [4,22], evaporation residues cross sections in [23]. The purpose of the present work is, first of all, a detailed study of the properties of fusion–fission and quasi-fission processes in this reaction at energies close to and below the Coulomb barrier manifested in the mass and energy characteristics of the fragments. Second, it is the study of peculiarities in the fragment MEDs caused by shell effects (multimodality) in the FF-process. The development of the time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET allowed us to perform this study with quite good mass and energy resolutions. We also report on the total capture-fission cross sections.

The material in the paper is presented as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the experimental procedure of measurements and data analysis. The main results of the experiments are given in Section 3. In Section 4 we discuss the properties of symmetric fission (Section 4.1), quasi-fission
(Section 4.2), capture-fission cross sections (Section 4.3), and shell effect manifestation in MEDs of the fusion–fission process (Section 4.4), followed by a summary in Section 5.

## 2. Experimental Method And Data Analysis

The experiment was carried out using a double-arm time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET [24].

Beams of 48Ca ions were produced at the U-400 accelerator of the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (Dubna). The beam currents were 10–20 nA, the targets were 180–270 µg/cm2 layers of 208Pb evaporated onto 50 µg/cm2 carbon backings. A kinematic coincidence method [4,6,25]
was used for the registration of reaction products.

A schematic drawing of the experimental arrangement is shown in Fig. 1. Each arm of the CORSET spectrometer consists of a Start micro-channel plate (MCP) detector with an electrostatic mirror and two position-sensitive Stop MCP-detectors. Start detectors are installed at a distance of 4 cm away from the target. The converter foils of electrostatic mirrors of the Start detectors are made from mylar (170 µg/cm2) with evaporated gold (30 µg/cm2) to increase secondary electron emission.

The coordinate system of Stop MCP-detectors is constructed with a delay-line readout technique and allowed one to measure coordinates in-(X) and perpendicular (Y ) to the horizontal plane. Two vertical and two horizontal copper strip masks 1 mm in thickness are mounted at the surface of each Stop detector as X and Y coordinate references. The size of each MCP-detector in the Stop assembly is 6×4 cm2. The distance between the target and Stop detectors is 15.5 cm,



the solid angle of the spectrometer is 360 msr. The spectrometer arms are placed at the angles Θ1lab = 57◦ and Θ2lab = 78◦ relative to the beam axis. The asymmetrical position of spectrometer arms was chosen to provide more favorable conditions for the registration of fragments with the mass ratio M1/M2 ≈ 2.5, where the quasi-fission component is expected.

Two semiconductor detectors placed at angles ±11◦ in the horizontal plane were used as monitors for the cross-section normalization.

A CAMAC based data acquisition system was used for data collecting. The detected reaction products were recorded into the files on the computer hard disk event by event. Each event consisted of signals from two coincident fragments and included the following parameters (see Fig. 1): time interval between Start1 and Stop1 detectors (time-of-flight TOF1), between Start2 and Stop2 (TOF2), between Start1 and Stop2 detectors (long time-of-flight, LTOF2), and between Start2 and Stop1 (LTOF1), the coordinates of particles in the Stop detectors were X1, Y1 and X2, Y2. The event was written if the signals from both Stop detectors and any Start detector were registered. The advantage of using two Start detectors is in the possibility to measure in coincidence normal TOF's and long TOF's and hence to determine the efficiency of each Start detector.

The MCP-detectors were home-made while other electronics adapted for the experiment were standard. The calibrations of MCP detectors with electronics were performed before the measurements with the use of a time calibrator ORTEC 462, α-source of 226Ra and spontaneous fission source of 252Cf. Position resolution of the Stop detectors was ±0.5 mm and the time resolution
(FWHM) obtained from the α-source of 226Ra was ∼ 180 ps.

The measurements of the reaction 48Ca + 208Pb were made in the energy range Elab =
206–242 MeV, and the accumulated statistics varied from 473 fission-like events for 211 MeV
to 7.8 × 105 for 240 MeV.

The data processing was performed in a usual procedure [6,7] assuming two-body kinematics.

Primary masses, velocities, energies and angles in the center-of-mass (CM) system of reaction products were calculated from measured velocities and angles in the lab-system using the mass and momentum conservation laws. For the calculation of primary masses and energies the iteration cycle was used which takes into account a change in the velocities due to ionization losses [26] in the target, backing and converter foils of electrostatic mirrors. The time-of-flight calibration was performed by the energies of registered elastically scattered 48Ca and 208Pb ions.

The spectrometer mass resolution (FWHM) was estimated by the peaks of elastic scattering events and was about 2–3 u. The selection of events from random coincidences and incomplete linear momentum transfer was performed event by event proceeding from the analysis of folding angle correlations in the center-of-mass system in- and out-of the reaction plane. Only events corresponding to the full linear momentum transfer (FLMT) were selected for a subse-



quent analysis. A circular contour "FoldXY" which is the circle with the radius R = 5° and center in OCM = 180° and UCM = 180° was used for the selection of FLMT events (see Fig. 2).

Θ CM = θ 1 CM + θ 2 CM is the sum of angles in-plane, while Ψ CM = ψ ICM + ψ 2 CM is the sum of angles out-of-plane of both reaction products in the CM system.

Since the fission, the quasi-fission, deep-inelastic, elastic and quasi-elastic scattering are binary processes, the average angle between two reaction products in the CM and its projections on any axis equal 180°. The radius of the circle contour R = 5° corresponds to ≈ 90% of the linear momentum transfer [27] for the symmetric fission fragments of the reaction 48 Ca + 208 Pb at E 1ab = 234 MeV. All distributions in Fig. 2 are shown in the logarithmic scale. Fig. 2(a) shows a two-dimensional matrix (TKE, M ) for all registered events. The "FF" contour in this figure separates fission-like fragments from the products of elastic, quasi-elastic and deep inelastic scattering. The products of energy straggling and small-angle scattering in target material and converter foils of the Start detectors are seen as tails (shown within the polygons in Fig. 2(c)),
coming from the elastic scattering peak to the mass symmetry with a strong decrease in the TKE [28]. The same data are shown in the coordinates ( Θ CM , Ψ CM ) —for all registered events
(Fig. 2(b)) and for the fission-like fragments from the contour "FF" (Fig. 2(d)). Fig. 2(c) shows a matrix of the extracted events in the coordinates (TKE, M) , corresponding to the contour "FoldXY" from Fig. 2(b), (d). Re-selected events in this contour are about 88% from the number of the fission fragment events as well as all the events. It is known that the width of the folding-angle distribution is determined by the following factors: (1) neutron emission from excited fragments, (2) angular resolution of Stop detectors, (3) angular struggling of particles in target, backing and Start detector converting foils, (4) uncertainty in the definition of the reaction point due to a finite size of the target and beam spot. For the energy E 1ab = 234 MeV FWHM of folding-angle distributions in- and out-of the reaction plane equals 4.3°. One can see that after



applying the circular contour "FoldXY" some part of small-angle scattering events still remain in the matrix (TKE, M) (within the polygons in Fig. 2(c)). It happens because the calculated folding angles include uncertainties in determining the reaction point due to a finite size of the target and beam, hence some part of re-scattered particles still remain in the (TKE, M) distribution.

Reaction products in the full mass range from projectile to target masses were registered by the spectrometer. However, since the spectrometer acceptance does not allow one to register all masses and energies of fragments with an equal probability, the corrections to the geometry efficiency were introduced. The calculations were performed assuming the two-body kinematics [6]
for the full range of masses and energies (see Fig. 3).

## 3. Results

Fig. 4 shows MEDs of the reaction products for the energies of 48Ca ions Elab = 211–
242 MeV. From top to bottom are shown—two-dimensional matrices (TKE, M), mass yields, normalized for the fragments (M = 60–196 u) by 200%, the dependences TKE(M) and σ2TKE(M). The reaction products with masses close to those of the projectile and target
(*Ap,t* ± 10) are elastic, quasi-elastic and deep-inelastic scattering events. The fission-like fragments are separated from the products of elastic and quasi-elastic scattering by the contours on the (TKE, M) matrices. Dependences of the TKE(M) and variance σ2TKE(M) on the fragment mass are shown below only for the separated fragments. Fig. 4 shows that at Elab = 225–
240 MeV mass distributions of fragments in the symmetric fission (M = ACN/2 ± 30) are close to a Gaussian in shape (shown in Fig. 4 by thin solid lines), whereas TKE(M) are parabolas.

Such a behavior of the above mentioned characteristics of fragments is typical for the fission of heated nuclei and predicted by the Liquid Drop Model [29] or Diffusion Model [30], in which shell properties of a fissioning nucleus become insignificant. At the same time, in the case of light fragments with masses 60 - ML - 90 and complimentary heavy fragments there are the so-called "shoulders" in the MD, i.e., the increased yield of the reaction products as compared with that expected in the classical symmetric fission. To the left and to the right from this region a smooth transition is observed to the events of deep-inelastic transfer (ML < 60 u) and to the classical compound nucleus fission (ML > 90 u). However, it is impossible to indicate exactly the boundaries of the "shoulders". For all the energies of 48Ca ions, the TKE(M) values are greater in the "shoulders" mass region as compared with those expected for the classical fission. These "shoulders" in MD, in our opinion, originate from the QF-process. The features of sym-

metric and asymmetric parts of the fragment MD separated by contours will be considered in more detail below and the main differences between these two processes will be described. Thus, the fragment MED consists of a quasi-fission and classical fission components. Parameters of the studied reactions and measured integral characteristics of the fission-like fragments are shown in Table 1. Parameters in columns 3–6 were obtained only for the fragments separated in Fig. 4 by contours. For the energies higher than the Coulomb barrier the excitation energies E∗ were calculated with the use of [31] taking into account the ionization losses of beam ions in the backing and in half-thickness of the target. For energies below the barrier Elab *< BC* the excitation energies E∗ were calculated with taking into account the sharp decrease in the capture-fission cross section with energy.

## 4. Analysis And Discussion

The properties of the classical symmetric fission typical of heated nuclei from the second part of the periodic table were studied in detail in the reactions with heavy ions and systematized in the review [32]. It is well known that in the fission of the heated nucleus the mass distribution of fragments is one-humped and close to a Gaussian in shape with the mass variance σ2M which increases approximately proportionally to the temperature of the fissioning nucleus, σ2M ∼ T , and the same is also valid for σ2TKE ∼ T . The average TKE does not depend on E∗ (or T ).

The experiments showed that an increase in the angular momentum l of the fissioning nucleus leads to an additional increase in σ2M in the case of heavy nuclei with the fissility parameter Z2*/A >* 30 and a decrease in σ2M in the case of light nuclei with Z2*/A <* 30 [32,35]. For 256No the Z2/A = 40.6.

To obtain the MED characteristics of the 256No symmetric fission we fitted the mass distribution of fragments (Fig. 4) into a Gaussian (G) (Figs. 4, 5).

The mass distributions in the logarithmic scale as a function of parameter (M − ACN/2)2, are shown in the left-hand side of Fig. 5. In this presentation the Gaussian is the linear function, and it is seen that starting from approximately (M − 128)2 ∼= 800–900 (ML ∼= 100) the experimental values deviate from the Gaussians, describing quite well the initial part of the scale (M − 128)2.



A similar method for determining the deviation of experimental values from Gaussian fits was used in the study of contributions of low-intensity fission modes in the modal approach [36]. In the center of Fig. 5 the same G -fits of MD are shown in the linear scale, and Table 1 presents the variances ( σ 2 t ) G of the Gaussians. The extracted quasi-fission "shoulders" for the light fragments are shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 5. They were obtained as a difference between the experimental yields and Gaussians fits:

$$Y_{\mathrm{QF}}(M)=Y_{\mathrm{exp}}(M)-Y_{G}(M).$$
$\left(\mathbb{I}\right)$. 
As mentioned above, (TKE)(M) is higher in the QF shoulder mass regions than expected for the FF process (see Fig. 4). Thus, the procedure of the MED decomposition can be performed in accordance with (1) and equation [37] :

$$\mathrm{TKE_{QF}=\left[TKE_{\mathrm{exp}}-TKE_{\mathrm{FF}}(Y_{\mathrm{FF}}/\,Y_{\mathrm{exp}})\right]/(Y_{\mathrm{QF}}/\,Y_{\mathrm{exp}}),}$$
$$(2)^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

here the dependence on M is implied for all the values. The experimental dependence (TKE)( M )
from Fig. 4 was described by the equation [38] :

$$\mathrm{TKE}(M)=\mathrm{TKE}_{A\mathrm{CN}/2}\bigl(1-\eta^{2}\bigr)\bigl(1+\rho\eta^{2}\bigr),\quad\eta=(M-A/2)/(A/2),$$
$$(3)$$





where η is the mass-asymmetric deformation parameter. The empirical parameter ρ determines the degree of the deviation of the (TKE) ( M ) experimental dependence from the parabolic dependence of the Liquid Drop Model (LDM) [29] , where ρ = 0. The dependence of the ρ -parameter on excitation energies E* is shown in Fig. 6. The parameter ρ was obtained for the symmetric mass range ( M = A CN /2 ± 30) u. As one can see there is good agreement with the results from the classical fission [32,39] at excitation energies E* = 23.9–41.8 MeV. Only at two lowest energies the ρ -parameter begins to decrease and sharply falls at E * = 17.2 MeV. This difference with LDM theory predictions deals with the manifestation of shell effects in the low energy fission of 256 No and will be considered in Section 4.4.

## 4.1. The Properties Of Symmetric Fission

Following the method applied in [32] we present in Fig. 7 the experimental dependences of ( σ 2 ) G , (TKE) and σ 2 KE on the nuclear temperature in the scission point T 3 C . The nuclear temperature in the scission point T sc was obtained as follows:

$$(4)$$

Tsc = (Esc/a)1/2, (4) Esc = E∗LD + Qf − TKE−νpreEν  − Esc rot − Edef + Ediss, (5) E∗LD = ECM + Mp + Mt − MLD CN, (6)
where E∗LD is the excitation energy of the nucleus, counted from the ground state of LDM.

Mp and Mt are the experimental mass defects for the target and projectile, MLD
CN is the LDM value of mass defect of the 256No compound nucleus taken from [31], a = 0.093ACN is the level density parameter [40]. Qf is the reaction energy for the symmetric fission, TKE
is the experimental average TKE. νpreEν  is the average energy taken away by pre-fission neutrons νpre calculated as suggested in [41]. The values of νpre taken from the systematics
[32] and from experimental works [33,34] are shown in Table 1. Edef is the energy coming from the fragment deformation. Ediss is the energy dissipated from the collective to single-particle degrees of freedom.

The rotation energy Esc rot in the scission point was determined according to the equation [42]

$$E_{\mathrm{rot}}^{\mathrm{sc}}=\ell^{2}\hbar^{2}/2J_{\perp}^{\mathrm{sc}}+T_{\mathrm{sc}}/2,$$

2/2J sc⊥ + Tsc/2, (7)
where J sc⊥ is the moment of inertia for the rotation perpendicular to the fission axis,  is the average angular momentum of the fissioning nucleus. In the LDM by Strutinsky [43] the scission point is defined as a critical point in which the nucleus looses its stability against decay into two fragments, and is given in units of the spherical rigid moment of inertia J0. For the nucleus 256No J sc⊥ ∼= 4.3J0 [32], therefore Esc rot ∼= E0rot/4.3 + Tsc/2. (8)

It is known from the classical Rotating Liquid Drop Model [44] that 
$$E_{\mathrm{rot}}^{\mathrm{sc}}\cong E_{\mathrm{rot}}^{0}/4.3+T_{\mathrm{sc}}/2.$$
$$({\mathfrak{s}})$$
$$E_{\mathrm{rot}}^{0}=34.54(\ell^{2}/A^{5/3}).$$
$$(9)$$
E0rot = 34.542/A5/3. (9)
There is no agreement at present about the values of Edef and Ediss. They are determined by theoretical models and depend on the character and values of nuclear viscosity (one-body or twobody). It should be taken into account that Edef and Ediss compensate each other to some extent.

That is why we following the works [32,42] accepted that Ediss − Edef = 0. The temperatures Tsc obtained according to Eq. (4) are presented in Table 1. Note that Tsc starts to grow very slowly in the case of high-energy projectiles when there is evaporation of the pre-fission neutrons νpre [32].

Fig. 7(a) shows that the values of TKE do not depend on Tsc (nucleus excitation) within the experimental errors. This behavior is typical of the fission of heavy and superheavy nuclei. The variance σ2TKE (Fig. 7(b)) for Tsc  1.83 MeV increases proportionally to Tsc. The crosshatched region of σ2TKE shows the range of variances typical of the classical fission. This region was determined in [32] for the fission of heavy nuclei produced in the reactions with ions with masses Ai < 26, taking into account the growth of σ2TKE with an increase in the angular momentum l. In the case of the temperature Tsc = 1.83 the values of σ2TKE do not decrease, and they even grow in the case of Tsc = 1.75 MeV (Elab = 211 MeV). This is due to the shell effect manifestation in MEDs of fragments at the low excitation energy of 256No.

The dependence of the mass variance (σ2M)G on Tsc for the energies of 48Ca ions Elab = 220–
242 MeV is shown in Fig. 7(c). The crosshatched part of the (σ2M)G values, as in Fig. 7(b),
indicates the area of changes in the (σ2M)G values for the classical fission. Since Tsc increases slowly with the projectile energy, the growth of (σ2M)G is to a large extent connected with an increase in the angular momentum of the fissioning nucleus l, where (σ2M)G ∼ l 2 as shown in
[32,42]. In Fig. 7(c) one can see that there is quite a sharp increase in the value of the variance
(σ2M)G at Tsc = 1.92–1.93 MeV (Elab = 240–242 MeV). The calculated values remain close, but outside the expected boundaries for the classical fission. We suppose that this happens due an increase in the QF drift to mass symmetry with the excitation energy. Thus, we conclude that MED characteristics of 256No fission fragments for the symmetric mass range 100 <M< 156 is close to the properties of the classical fusion–fission process at Elab = 220–234 MeV. Nevertheless, some deviations from the FF process characteristics are observed in the mass yields at Elab = 211–218 MeV. Also there are some deviations for all studied energies in the dependence σ2TKE(M) from the known [38] correlation TKE2*(M)/σ*2TKE(M) = const, in the symmetric mass region M = 115–141 u. The investigation of this anomalous behavior of variances will be considered below in Section 4.4.

## 4.2. The Properties Of The Quasi-Fission Process

As is known, the main experimental evidences of the quasi-fission process are the large mass distribution width, much larger than that in the compound nucleus fission, asymmetry in the fission fragment mass-angle distribution and large angular anisotropy [7]. These characteristics deal with incomplete relaxation in the mass asymmetry and K-equilibration degrees of freedom. As for the energy characteristics, it was believed earlier that the TKE in QF did not differ from that of FF. Later it was found [32,37] that the TKE on the average was higher in QF then that of compound nucleus fission. It was also shown in [37] that FF and QF fragments could be separated since they satisfied formally a hypothesis on independent fission modes [38,45].

The mass distributions of light QF fragments for all energies are shown in the right-hand side of Fig. 5. Fig. 8 shows the mass distributions together with energy characteristics for Elab =
234 MeV and 225 MeV. QF mass distributions are shown in Fig. 8(a), (c) and TKE(M) in Fig. 8(b), (d). It is clearly seen that the TKE for QF (TKEQF) is higher in the region of QF
"shoulders" by 7–15 MeV than that of the FF process, and it is on the whole a parabola in shape, which is also a formal similarity with the modes of classical low-energy fission [46].

However, the parabolic dependence TKEQF(M) has a larger width than that of the TKEFF(M)
(ρ(QF) = 0.6 for Elab = 234 MeV and ρ(QF) = 0.8 for 225 MeV).

A natural explanation of the MED properties (increased mass yield and the higher TKE(M)
values in the region 60 *< ML* < 90) in the QF process is the manifestation of shell effects.

The positions of closed spherical shells with Z = 28 and N = 50 are indicated in Fig. 8(a)
and Fig. 8(c) by arrows. They were found proceeding from the assumption on the Unchanged Charge Density (UCD). In the case of 256No, only the light "quasi-fission shoulder" corresponds to closed shells. The complementary heavy fragment belongs to the mass region MH ∼ 166–
196 u, and this is far from magic closed shell of 208Pb. The manifestation of shell effects in QF
has been discussed for a long time [5,47,48], but those cases were mostly considered in which massive ions interacted with actinide targets (or 238U-projectiles with different targets, in the inverse kinematics). In such reactions [5,8] two-humped MD with masses of heavy fragments corresponding to the doubly magic lead MH ≈ 208 (ZH ≈ 82, NH ≈ 126) was observed. In the reactions 48Ca + 238U and 244Pu, 248Cm at the excitation energy E∗ ≈ 30 MeV the influence of magic shells on the properties of QF of superheavy nuclei also was discovered. In these cases shell structures of both heavy (near 208Pb) and light (near 78Ni) fragments play a significant role. In the considered reaction, 48Ca + 208Pb, a doubly magic lead shell, typical of SHE, in the heavy fragment corresponds to the reaction entrance channel. So, in contrast to the reaction with



actinide targets the QF events due to the lead shell are hidden in MEDs under elastic/quasi-elastic and deep-inelastic events.

In order to obtain more information about the properties of the quasi-fission MED the decomposition of the experimental MEDs into different processes (modes) was performed using a method proposed in Ref. [46] . Usually this method is applied for the study of the fission fragment MED in the modal approach. Here we firstly applied it to the study of the FF/QF contribution into the MED of 256 No. The method needs high statistical matrices and we employed it for the measurements at E 1ab = 234 and 240 MeV.

In our case we are considering two independent modes, i.e., the symmetric liquid-drop mode S
and asymmetric quasi-fission mode Q 1 which together form the experimental MED of fragments. For each fixed mass the TKE distribution was described for both modes with the use of the Charlier functions. The dependence of the average total kinetic energy on the fragment mass for each mode was the same as in Eq. (3) and the relation between the total kinetic energy and the kinetic energy variance for each mode is (TKE) 2 (M)/ σ f κ R (M) = const [38,46] . A relative contribution of each mode was found using a standard computer code MINUIT. The fitting procedure is described in detail in work [46] . The results of the decomposition of MEDs of fission-like fragments into the MEDs of different modes are shown in Fig. 9. The upper panels show the MEDs of fission-like fragments at two energies E lab = 234 and 240 MeV. The middle panels show the symmetric components S . The distributions of the quasi-fission events in the lower panels of Fig. 9 are obtained as a difference between the experimental MEDs and symmetric liquid-drop modes S . At the bottom panels the dependences of the average total kinetic energy on the fragment mass (TKE) ( M ) for the symmetric fission S (solid lines) and the quasi-fission Q 1 (dashed lines) are also shown.



Both one-dimensional (Fig. 8) and two-dimensional analyses (Fig. 9) lead to the same results: a higher TKE in the region of QF shoulders than that predicted for the true fission; and much greater manifestation of shell effects with Z = 28, N = 50 for the QF process. Meanwhile a two-dimensional analysis in coordinates (TKE, M ) reveals that in the case of the reaction 48 Ca + 208 Pb the shape of QF wings is very similar to that from the reaction of 48 Ca-ions on actinide targets [8], where the QF process dominates. However, the application of the twodimensional analysis requires high statistics measurements.



The differential cross sections were measured at the laboratory system angles Θ 11ab = 57 ±
18° and Θ 21ab = 78 ± 18° at the bombarding energies E 1ab = 206–242 MeV. Two semiconductor monitors were installed to the left and to the right of the beam axis at an angle of ± 11° for the registration of elastically scattered 48 Ca ions. The monitors were used for the absolute cross section normalization and control of quality of the beam and its position on the target.

Since we did not measure the angular distribution of fission fragments in order to obtain the integral capture cross sections we used the results presented in [20]. In this paper the same reaction was measured and it was shown that the angular distribution of fission-like fragments did not differ very much (within the experimental errors) from the values calculated for the fusion–
fission process. Fig. 10 shows the capture-fission cross section in dependence on the compound nucleus excitation energy E * (only the fission-like events separated by contours in Fig. 4 were taken in the calculation of the capture cross section). As one can see from Fig. 10, our data are in good agreement with the data from works [4,20] .

In the experiments on the synthesis of superheavy nuclei the ratio of the number of events from symmetric fragmentation, namely belonging to the range of A CN /2 ± 20 u and (TKE) ± 25 MeV,
to the capture events (shown in the (TKE, M ) matrices by contours in Fig. 4) is often used for the estimation of the fusion–fission cross section. For 256 No this ratio equals ≈ 60% at the excitation energies E* = 17–35 MeV.

## 4.4. Low Energy Fission Of 256 No

As we mentioned in the Introduction, the bimodal fission of superheavy nuclei manifests itself most prominently in the spontaneous fission of nuclei in the Fm–Rf region. The properties





of these nuclei may change radically at the excitation, for example from the asymmetric mass distribution in the case of spontaneous fission of 256 Fm(sf) [49,50] to the symmetric one in the reaction 255Fm(n th , f) at E* = 6.4 MeV [49,51]. For 258 Fm(sf) [11] and 257 Fm(n th , f) [52,53]
the mass distribution changes from a very narrow symmetric to symmetric one also, but a few times wider. With in increase in the excitation energy shell effects start to fade away, but at E * = 10–20 MeV the MED modal structure is still observed.

In work [14] the narrow asymmetric mass distribution was observed in the spontaneous fission of 256 No with the heavy peak mass M = 138 u. The MEDs of fission fragments for 48 Ca ions at E lab = 211 MeV and 218 MeV were shown above in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. There are no pre-fission neutrons at these excitation energies (see Table 1), and hence the real excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus does not differ from the initial one. It is clearly seen that MDs at these low excitation energies are far from being a Gaussian in shape. Flat structured peaks are observed in the region of heavy fragment masses MH ≈ 128–135 u. An increased yield of fragments as compared with the Gaussian shape of MD appears in the region of masses MH = 145–155 u at E lab = 211 MeV. At this energy the parabolic shape of the (TKE)(M) dependence becomes very narrow, and parameter ρ equals to − 2.2 (see Figs. 4. 6). Thus we observed a strong deviation of the mass distribution from the LDM shape. Such a behavior of fragments in MEDs is determined by the shell effects in the low-energy fission of 256 No.

The total and differential mass distributions for TKE > 201 MeV and TKE < 201 MeV are presented in Fig. 11 for the projectile energy E 1ab = 211 and 218 MeV. In the case of TKE >
201 MeV (Fig. 11(b), (e)) a narrow two-humped structure is distinctly seen in the region of heavy masses MH ≈ 131–135 u. The shape of this distribution is very similar to that in the MD
of spontaneous fission of neighboring nuclei 259 Lr ( Z = 103) [13,54]. Fig. 11 shows a wide



flat MD in the region of heavy fragment masses MH ≈ 140–150 u at TKE < 201 MeV. Such a behavior of the MD low-energy component is also typical of the superheavy nucleus fission, for example for the spontaneous fission of 259 Md (Z = 101) [11] or 260 Md [55] . Thus, one can see that the 256 No mass distribution at E * = 17.2 and 22.8 MeV consists of at least two components
(modes).

Fig. 12 shows energy distributions of 256 No for the energies of 48 Ca ions Elab = 211242 MeV. The TKE distributions for the whole mass range are shown in the left-hand side of the figure; TKE distributions for the symmetric mass range M = 124–132 u (i.e., for the masses whose MD is two-humped, Fig. 11) are shown in the right-hand side. The TKE distributions of the selected symmetric masses practically do not differ from integral distributions at energies E lab = 220–242 MeV. However, at the lowest projectile energies E lab = 218 and 211 MeV two components of the TKE appear in the region of symmetric masses, i.e., a low-energy one with
(TKE) 10w ~ 200 MeV, and a high energy one with (TKE) nigh ~ 233 MeV. These TKE values as well as mass yields are typical of the standard and SS modes in the spontaneous fission of superheavy nuclei [ 13 - 16 ]. Thus, we observed here both in the mass and energy distributions the presence of SS-mode in the 256 No induced fission, although on the whole the contribution of the





SS-mode is quite small and equals ≈ 2.5% at E lab = 211 MeV. This minimal contribution of the SS-mode was obtained as a ratio of the sum of the high energy component in the energy distribution (Fig. 12 ) for masses M = 124–132 (right column) to the total TKE yield (left column). The same ratio equals ≈ 1.7% for E lab = 218 MeV and decreases to ≈ 0.3% for E lab = 234 MeV
(see Fig. 13 ).

The clear manifestation of the SS-mode was observed both in the mass and energy distributions at the energies E tab = 211 and 218 MeV. However, the dependence σ 2 K F ( M ) has a moderately wide peak for the masses M ≈ 115–141 u for all studied energies. The presence of irregularities in the variance σ T K E ( M ) reveals a complicated MED structure (this property was used in the study of multimodal fission in the region of Pb and At [36]). To understand the reason for such an anomalous behavior of the variance we present in the right-hand sides of Fig. 13 the TKE yield for different mass ranges at E 1ab = 234 MeV. One can see that in the total distribution and symmetric masses M = 124–132 u there is a high energy component in the TKE, similar to that at E 1ab = 211 and 218 MeV, but with a lower yield. It becomes noticeable only at a higher TKE > 245 MeV, at a lower TKE it is covered by the main "dome" of the LDM fission. For more asymmetric mass regions M L ≤ 120 u the TKE distributions have a simple one-humped structure. To study the origin of the peak in the variance σ TKE ( M ) we also applied the following method (Fig. 14): the two-dimensional matrix (TKE, M ) was divided into various TKE regions, then the MED characteristics, namely, mass yield, (TKE)( M ) and σ TKE ( M ) were analyzed for

63



the selected TKE ranges. It is seen that the peak in the variance disappears in the case of events with TKE < 230 MeV. It means that events with TKE > 230 MeV account for the peak in the variance σ T K F ( M ) in the symmetric mass region. Thus, on the whole, the properties of fission of 256 No at E lab = 234 MeV ( E* = 35.1 MeV, respectively), are close to those of the liquid drop fission for mass range M = 100–156 u, but there are some structural features typical of the low-energy fission.

Let us analyze qualitatively the observed picture. If one proceeds from a traditional assumption on the proportionality of the fragment charge and mass, then for the mass region MH = 131–
135 u the charge of heavy fragment ZH = 52-54 and the neutron number NH = 79-81. So ZH
is slightly greater than the magic number Z = 50, whereas NH is slightly less than the magic number N = 82. For the complementary light fragments with masses M L = 121–125, the charge Z L = 48–50, and the neutron number N L = 73–75, that is the charge of the light fragment is close to the magic number, but the neutron number is significantly less than the magic number N = 82. Thus, the SS-mode appears due to the proximity of the nucleon composition both by N
and Z to the magic numbers in the heavy fragment, and only by Z —in the light fragment. Since the total neutron number is not sufficient for filling spherical shells in both fragments simultaneously, this mode is not dominant in the case of 256 No and does not manifest itself strongly.

Another interesting peculiarity could be seen in the variance σ 2 KE ( M ) from Fig. 14. With a decrease in the TKE values (TKE < 220 MeV and TKE < 210 MeV) the peaks in the dependence a TKE appear to be more prominent in the mass region of QF "shoulders" ( ML = 60-90 u) where both FF and QF processes coexist.

Our measurement shows that the SS-mode appears in the fission of 256 No at excitation energies of up to 42 MeV. It may seem strange that shell effects still appear at so high excitation energies. According to theoretical estimations [56,57] the fission barrier for 256 No is E f = 6.4 —
8 MeV. It was shown in works [58,59] that the fission barrier for 254 No, produced in the reaction 208 pb( 48 Ca, 2n ) at the nucleus spin from 12n to 22n was Ef > 5 MeV. It means that in our case, i.e., the fission of 256No, the excitation energy in the saddle point is E∗sp = 10–12 MeV for Elab = 211 MeV; and E∗sp = 22–24 MeV for Elab = 234 MeV with taking into account 0.8 prefission neutrons. That is why the real excitation energy at the formation of fission fragments turns out to be rather low, and the shell effects responsible for the fission valley structure of potential energy surface have an influence on the MEDs of fragments, which is reflected in their structural features seen from Figs. 4, 5, 13 and 14.

Thus, the shell effect manifestation was observed in the MED of 256No at a moderate excitation energy. The SS mode decreases with an increase in the excitation energy from 2.5% for E∗ = 17.2 MeV to 0.3% at E∗ = 35.1 MeV for the nearly symmetric range of fragment masses M = ACN/2 ± 4.

## 5. Conclusion

Mass-energy distributions and capture-fission cross sections of the fragments were measured in the reaction 48Ca + 208Pb → 256No at the 48Ca projectile energies of 206–242 MeV using a double-arm time-of-flight spectrometer CORSET.

It was found that MEDs of fission-like fragments consisted of two parts, corresponding to the classical fusion–fission process of the compound nucleus 256No with a symmetric mass division, and the quasi-fission "shoulders" with the light fragment masses ML ≈ 60–90 u. It was also demonstrated that the observed properties of the fission-like fragment MEDs satisfied formally a hypothesis on the existence of two independent fission modes, only in this case these are the classical FF and QF processes.

The QF shoulders have a higher TKE by 7–15 MeV as compared with that expected for the FF process. We came to a conclusion that the spherical shells Z = 28 and N = 50 played a significant role in QF of the 256No.

The analysis of the MEDs at Elab = 220–234 MeV shows that the symmetric fission properties in the mass range 100 <M< 156 are close to these in the classical fusion–fission process described by the LDM. However, there are some structural peculiarities in the MEDs caused by the shell effects. The high-energy Super-Short mode was revealed in the region of heavy fragment masses MH = 130–135 u. The minimal yield of this mode is ≈ 2.5% at the energy Elab = 211 MeV and it decreases to ≈ 0.3% at 234 MeV.
