Samples with x = 0.95, 0.90, and 0.85 taken from the end portions of the ingots are chemically homogeneous and have p-type conductivity with a 300-K hole concentration below 1012 cm–3. Temperature-dependent electrical conductivity measurements are used to evaluate the ionization energies of electrically active centers.

## Introduction

CdxZn1 - xTe solid solutions are well-known promising semiconducting materials, which have been the subject of extensive studies over the past decade. Most of the research effort has been concentrated on the growth of high-resistivity, defect-rich CdxZn1 - xTe crystals, primarily by the Bridgman method.

It is, however, well known that, because of the complex phase relations in the CdTe–ZnTe system, chemically homogeneous CdxZn1 - xTe crystals are extremely difficult to grow from the melt: solid solutions enriched in ZnTe, the higher melting point end-member, are always the first to crystallize.

In view of this, we used sublimation of presynthesized solid solutions to grow CdxZn1 - xTe crystals.

In this paper, we report the growth and electrical properties of CdxZn1 - xTe crystals.

## Experimental

A major problem in sublimation growth is to obtain single-crystal ingots having the same composition as the growth charge. To this end, a certain vapor composition and a slight vapor supersaturation at the growth interface must be maintained, and the latent heat of crystallization must be removed rapidly, which implies that quasi-isothermal conditions are needed. For example, Szczerbacow *et al.* [1] reported that, in the growth of CdxZn1 - xTe crystals by this method, the evaporation and condensation temperatures differed by 1–2°C.

Under such conditions, however, we failed to grow single-crystal ingots. In view of this, we used a three-zone growth geometry (Fig. 1) to prepare CdxZn1 - xTe crystals. The evaporation and growth conditions were determined by temperatures t2 and t3 , which differed by 4−5°C. Varying the temperature of the third zone, t1 , we tuned the vapor supersaturation at the growth interface; t1 exceeded t2 by 3–4°C. A key role in determining the thermal conditions of crystal growth was played by temperature t2: the choice of t1 and t3 depended on t2 . In our experiments, t2 was 100°C below the solidus temperature of the solid solution. The growth ampule



(Fig. 1) was pulled at a rate of 0.3–0.4 mm/h. Nucleation took place in a capillary fused to the ampule.

## Results And Discussion

Chemical analysis of sublimation-grown crystals showed that the ingot composition was the same as the charge composition only in the case of quasi-isothermal conditions, that is, at low temperature gradients at the growth interface and slow ampule pulling.

At large differences between t2 and t3 (>10°C),
selective etching of the (111) face revealed prismatic inclusions surrounded by mosaic blocks. At such temperature gradients, the ingot (especially its upper portion) and growth charge differed somewhat in composition. Moreover, under such growth conditions the concentration of electrically active centers determining the electrical conductivity of the material varied along the ingot, which was probably due to the high vapor supersaturation at the growth interface and compositional fluctuations in the vapor phase.

From the spectral dependences of the photocurrent through samples taken from different parts of the ingots and the absorption coefficients of the samples at 300 and 80 K, we determined the band gap of CdxZn1 - xTe as a function of composition. We obtained Eg = 1.60 ±
0.05 eV at x = 0.95 and 1.67 ± 0.05 eV at x = 0.90, in reasonable agreement with the linear dependence of Eg on composition. These data were then used to determine sample composition (the uncertainty was within 5%).

All of the ingots were p-type, with a hole concentration below 1012 cm–3 and 300-K hole mobility from 40 to 80 cm2 /(V s), depending on the sample.

Figures 2 and 3 show the Arrhenius plots of dark conductivity for samples taken from different parts of the Cd0.9Zn0.1Te ingot. As seen, the samples differ in both electrical conductivity and the slope of the plots in the impurity region. In the temperature range studied, the slope of the plots (ionization energy of electrically active centers) for the samples cut from the upper end of the ingot is 0.55, 0.44, 0.36, and 0.33 eV. The samples taken from the back end of the ingot contained acceptor centers with ionization energies Ev + (0.012– 0.22) and Ev + (0.28–0.35) eV (Fig. 3).

Near liquid-nitrogen temperature, some of the samples contained shallow electrically active centers with ionization energies of 0.56 and 0.76 eV, as determined from the spectral dependences of the photocurrent.

Most of the centers in CdxZn1 - xTe have the same ionization energies as in CdTe. Kosyachenko *et al.* [2]
proposed a classification of electrically active centers according to their energy. In that classification, centers with ionization energies in the range Ev + (0.12–0.20) eV
are assumed to be acceptor complexes each composed of a doubly charged cadmium vacancy and a donor impurity: ( D+)– VCd . Note, however, that levels with 2–



The level with an ionization energy of 0.28 eV is worthy of special mention. According to Mayer and Stadler [3], this level is due to Cu impurity. In this work, however, it appears systematically in samples that have been in contact with the silica ampule and may, therefore, be contaminated with both silicon and oxygen [4].



energies of 0.12 and, e.g., 0.17 eV may be encountered in the same sample.



The second group is constituted by electrically active centers with energies Ev + (0.33–0.44 eV).

According to Hage-Ali and Siffert [5], these are native defects, in particular singly charged cadmium vacancies, which no doubt play an important part in out samples. Such ionization energies are, however, also characteristic of Cu: Ev + (0.28–0.35 eV) [3].

Figure 4 shows the Arrhenius plots of dark conductivity for a sample with x = 0.9 which was exposed to an oxygen atmosphere at 300 K for ten days and then stored in air for eight months. After the oxygen exposure, the slope of the plot is 0.36 eV. Subsequent air storage has no effect on the slope.

Note that crystals grown in a hydrogen atmosphere typically have a level with an ionization energy of 0.33 eV, while levels at 0.36 eV are very uncommon in such crystals.

Thus, the conductivity of CdxZn1 - xTe crystals is determined by a rather broad spectrum of electrically active centers. The spread in ionization energies obtained in electrical measurements is attributable primarily to the changes produced in the energy of acceptors by the Coulombic interaction between ionized donors and also to relaxation processes, which take place in all of the crystals under consideration. Relaxation processes are more pronounced in high-resistivity crystals with deep levels. The relaxation time in such crystals depends on temperature and may attain several hours. For this reason, equilibrium is essentially never reached in temperature-dependent resistivity measurements, especially at low temperatures, and the activation energy evaluated from temperature-dependent resistivity data is always overestimated.

## Conclusions

The present results demonstrate that sublimation growth can be used to prepare CdxZn1 - xTe crystals close in structural perfection to Bridgman-grown crystals.
