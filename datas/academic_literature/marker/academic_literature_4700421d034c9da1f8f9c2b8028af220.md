# Benchmarks For A History Of Liturgical Formation

Patrick Pré tot, osb* As I begin, I would like to extend my warmest thanks to the council and those who organized the Québec Congress for having invited me to speak today. I 
was particularly touched by this invitation because, as you know, I had to stand aside, much to my regret, from the organization of this Congress. So I would like to express before you all my grateful affection towards Lizette Larson-Miller, for this gesture of fellowship, and above all for having accepted to take over from me as president. Our president elect Martin Stuflesser and all the members of the council are of course included in this heartfelt thank-you. To be perfectly truthful, I should mention that I hesitated before accepting this invitation to speak here in Québec, because the underlying reasons for my well-founded decision not to come to Würzburg remain. At the same time, I had to re-orient my future academic obligations. And so it is with modesty and gratitude that I stand here before you this morning. I am as aware of the extent of the honour that you bestow on me as of my limits as to the task at hand.

## Introduction

This presentation is obviously not going to attempt a synthesis of the history of liturgical formation. The subject is not a totally unexplored area, but as far as my research into the question has been able to enlighten me, it remains a subject that

has been not much studied for itself1, even by liturgical historians2. When the question has indeed been taken up, it has been principally approached from the point of view of contemporary problematics, and in the context of reflection upon liturgical theology and pastoral practice3. We should also take note that in standard French studies of the history of education4, for example Henri-Irénée Marrou's *L'histoire de l'éducation dans l'Antiquité*5 or Pierre Riché's (Marrou's disciple and successor at the Sorbonne) classic works, Éducation et culture dans l'Occident barbare and *Ecoles et enseignement dans le* 1 La question semble avoir échappé aux concepteurs du manuel francophone de liturgie : cf.

Haut Moyen Âge6, the question of "liturgical formation" is not dealt with as such. It does make an appearance in these authors' studies of Christian Initiation7, but the question of how laity and clergy were formed to liturgical life is not raised. This relative silence is no doubt the result of separation between different fields of academic study; although historians of liturgy and historians of education are not unaware of each other's existence, the dynamics of their respective studies have never led them to construct a common object for their research. Although the subject of liturgical history does not appear in the tables of contents of historical publications, the question itself is far from absent. For example, Pierre Riché, in a passage on "Elementary and Specialised Teaching", points out that in early medieval programmes of study, "reading and chant were complementary subjects. Students memorized through song not only psalms, but also the short Latin texts they were to study".8 Then he adds this important remark:
All children, even if they do not have good voices, were to learn to sing. When Charlemagne made *cantus* part of his programme's obligatory core content, his object was both general formation and liturgical studies. The children were to start participating in liturgical services, and to learn to sing on the basis of psalms, hymns and canticles.9 So it is already clear that, from the point of view of history, at least in the earlier periods, liturgical formation is probably "hiding itself " in "general formation," and runs the risk of remaining invisible as much to historians as to liturgists. We may even make the hypothesis that, over time, liturgical formation will become all the more visible and necessary in so far as "general formation" loses its living link to the liturgy. This first element can orient further research; at a time when processes of transmission are breaking down, it would be helpful to dig deeper into this fundamental aspect, in particular on the basis of documents like hagiographical sources and canonical collections10, with a view to coming to a better understanding of the way the major benchmarks of liturgical experience were handed on in the 

## Past, Within Christian Living.

Having set this background, I shall now seek to shed light on the relationship played out through history between, on one hand, liturgy in its celebration, and on the other, what we can place under the approximate heading of "liturgical formation". I have just used the adjective "approximate" because it is clear to me that the notion of "liturgical formation" hides a multitude of realities. It is to be hoped that the different approaches that will become apparent during our Congress will help us to delineate the subject with greater clarity, a subject whose foundational character was underlined by the Liturgical Movement, and whose essential importance for teachers of liturgy is now evident. The risk we run is that of a certain confusion if we do not distinguish the varied realities lurking behind this notion. At the least, a historical survey can help us to realize just how complex the idea of "liturgical formation" is, by calling into question oversimplifications which present it as a homogenous reality over the course of time. The very diversity of the expressions used to designate it though history is a sign of a constant plurality of practices as well as of understandings. Today, under the influence of the Liturgical Movement, we usually speak of "liturgical formation" or "formation for liturgy", and while the term "mystagogy" has recently reappeared, in the Early Modern period liturgists seem to have favoured the expressions "explanations" and "instructions".11 In order to set the character of liturgical formation into its historical context, or rather contexts, I shall divide my account into historical stages, with a view to identifying the various actors, places and moments that play a role in the process, as well as to working out as much as possible of its aims and methods. This approach is not without risk. There will be no difficulty to find exceptions that do not fit into the suggested outline. Moreover, in order fully to take into account the complexity of the historical reality, it would be necessary to extend the investigation well beyond what is possible here. However, in the absence of a more precise survey, this approach may at least allow us to reach a general idea of the question. To begin, a few methodological reflections seem necessary.

## 1. On The Notion Of "Liturgical **Formation"**

We should begin by taking note that the notion of "liturgical formation", meaning the transmission of an intellectual knowledge concerning liturgy, is no doubt a recent idea, born in the Liturgical Movement, where it became one of its most vital aspects12. It is not going too far to say that this concern for formation was at the origin of the development between 1841 and 1962 of an educative project that today seems almost inconceivable. Furthermore, this project reached the whole of the Christian people, and was embodied in numerous publications, articles, sessions, congresses, and above all in the publishing of missals like those of Dom Gaspar Lefebvre (1880–1966), a Benedictine of the monastery of Saint-André-lez-Bruges13.

This provisional definition of "liturgical formation" as "the transmission of an intellectual knowledge concerning liturgy" matches what comes to mind naturally when we hear the expression. Of course liturgical formation goes well beyond this approximate and provisional definition; hence two further important remarks are called for.

In the first place, just as the pairs "*worship*" - "*liturgy*" in English, "*Liturgie*" - "*Kult*" in German, and "*liturgie*" - "*culte*" in French are not perfectly equivalent, the term "formation" probably does not point to the same mental representations in our different languages and cultures. This is partly because of differing traditions as to the manner of teaching. But it is also rooted in the very nature of the matter at hand. What is at issue here is not only a "knowledge about" (*savoir sur*) liturgy, but also "knowing how to be" (*savoir-être*), a "knowing how to do" (*savoir-faire*), and even an important element of "knowing how to live" (*savoir-vivre*). So we can already see that the notion of formation masks a highly complex reality.14 It is thus probable that the relative silence on this subject that I pointed out earlier results from the difficulty it presents. In the second place, this is true not only in space, but also over time. While it is certainly true that the Liturgical Movement had a decisive impact on the idea of formation, it is important to counterbalance this by pointing out that a concern for liturgical formation is by no means limited to the contemporary period. What is true of liturgical inculturation is also true of liturgical formation; the Church has always been confronted with the necessity of transmitting its practices, even though the ways of so doing have differed over the course of time.15 This preoccupation existed long before the Liturgical Movement, but no doubt in a different manner, and, above all, without the use of the word "formation".

The importance of this preoccupation is striking; the learned publications on the liturgy published in France throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries16 favour the word "instruction" and employ an explanatory paradigm. It is no secret that Early Modernity bears the mark of the forces unleashed by Luther and the other reformers, and of their desire that the disciples of Christ not be abandoned to ignorance. This desire was echoed within the Roman Catholic Church in the educational institutions developed after the Council of Trent; here in Québec we can cite the work of Early Modern religious orders like the Society of Jesus and the Ursulines. Liturgical historiography over the past century has perhaps overly neglected this Early Modern period because of the justifiable attraction for the primitive and patristic periods. But the Early Modern period has much to teach us about the prehistory of that concern for formation that was so important for the Liturgical Movement.17

## 2. A Historical Setting To Permit A General Overview

As I said in my introduction, what follows is an overview divided into historical periods with a view to identifying the principal stages of the history of liturgical formation.18 But as Father Pierre-Marie Gy often pointed out, although division into historical periods can be helpful, such divisions are always somewhat artificial and so partly false. The divisions created never quite match the slow evolution of practices and representations that characterize liturgical life.19 However, and despite these necessary precautions, we shall adopt a division into four or five main periods. The first period runs until the emergence of the earliest liturgical institutions; hence it ends towards the middle of the fourth century. The second period is the "high" patristic era. The third stage is the Middle Ages. It is important here to bear in mind that the Middle Ages is anything but a homogenous block, and with regard to formation, the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries are worlds away from the ninth century; the emergence of universities in the thirteenth century constitutes a sort of turning point.20 Finally, the Early Modern / Modern period brings with it a new situation. The Liturgical Movement was in part the product of this situation, and at the same time the result of a sustained effort to move on, as can be seen in certain of Dom Guéranger's writings. So it would be possible to speak of a fifth period inaugurated by the Liturgical Movement, because of the ways it transformed participation in the liturgy21 as well as its methods of scientific investigation that would serve as a basis for formation. Liturgical formation is durably marked by the development of historical studies of liturgy following on from Msgr Duchesne.22 Indeed over several decades liturgical formation was more or less identified with a knowledge 

## Of Liturgical History.23

Within the setting of a paper delivered to this Congress, without going into detail, I shall limit myself to calling attention to the essential structures of formation, by identifying its principal actors, the context of the act of formation, and the contents that were transmitted. I am indebted for my hypothesis to an article on "practical and spiritual theology" by René Marlé S.J., in which he suggests understanding the diversification of theology over time as a process of progressive distinction and even separation between Scripture, theology, liturgy and spirituality.24 In this evocative synthesis written for a theology textbook, Marlé notes that in the patristic age, as well as during part of the Middle Ages (the example of St. Anselm comes to mind), the form of theological discourse was "above all, if not exclusively, a scriptural commentary." He adds that in this situation, "theology was directly spiritual, indeed it was also pastoral, and developed spontaneously into prayer or exhortation." But he goes on to point out that since the later Middle Ages theology has taken:
… the form of an often highly rarefied and subtle critique of the language of faith and of the possibilities of discourse concerning God, and … in parallel, a growing number of works and pamphlets, seeking, in varying registers, to account for the *experience* of faith.25 In other terms, since the Middle Ages, the splitting of theological reflection into Scripture, theology and liturgy has isolated liturgy as a ritual practice generally safeguarded by a body of rules destined to ensure its correct execution.26 This splitting can be said to have "given sanctuary" to liturgy by cutting it off from ethical responsibility and even, all too often, from the seeking of God. My intention is now to consider our different historical periods from the point of view of liturgical formation in the light of this hypothesis.

## 3. The Primitive Church

After the first generations follows the period of the apostolic Fathers, a time that can be described as "pre-Constantinian", covering the second and third centuries. I shall group these two periods together, although an attentive reading of our past president Gordon Lathrop's recent book, *The Four Gospels on Sunday,* would invite us to distinguish these two periods27; the years during which the biblical canon was slowly worked out obeyed a dynamic that escapes us for the most part, but which also certainly left an essential mark on the formation of believers. During these early periods, Christian institutions were still in gestation; their embryonic forms were tributary to their regional contexts, and above all handed on orally. Only a tiny quantity of evidence remains, which raises the permanent risk of reading too much into it. We can of course cite important documents like the *Didachè*,
28 the letters of Ignatius of Antioch,29 Tertullian's work on baptism,30 or even, and especially, the Apostolic Tradition.31 Nonetheless, it is now widely recognized how quickly any attempt to suggest general reconstructions runs up against inevitable historiographical difficulties.32 However, it is probably true that in this early period, the inheritance of Jewish institutions played a significant role, so that the study of the Jewish origins of Christian worship may be illuminating. But it is also clear that recent historiography on this subject lacks sufficient consensus to draw firm conclusions.33 During this first period, the first actors were without doubt the apostles, but also, after them, and before the hierarchical structure: bishop/presbyterium and deacons, emerged, didascales carried the new faith's message. So it was the Gospel, that is to say the proclamation of the Good News, in particular through the Gospel stories, but also Paul's letters, that constituted the first means of liturgical formation. As Gordon Lathrop stressed in his opening address at the Würzburg Congress,34 these were concerned not so much with saying something about liturgy as with reforming assemblies so that they might live as authentic disciples of Jesus. Of course, while the New Testament and the earliest Christian writings were never textbooks for liturgical formation, we may still rapidly take note of two
