# Palaeomagnetism Of The Upper Carboniferous–Lower Permian Transition From Paganzo Basin, Argentina

## Summary

A palaeomagnetic study of Upper Palaeozoic rocks was performed on Paganzo basin, centralwestern Argentina and its western extension, R´ıo Blanco subbasin. The volcanic–volcaniclastic R´ıo del Pe˜n´on and marine sedimentary Punta del Agua formations were sampled in the Rinc´on Blanco syncline. Both units represent the Upper Carboniferous–Lower Permian transition according to palaeontological and geochronological evidence. The Chancan´ı and Cerro ColoradoCaminiaga formations were sampled in their type localities, in the eastern Paganzo basin.

All-reversed, pre-tectonic characteristic magnetizations were isolated in all three localities, spanning a wide lithological variation. Particularly in the Rinc´on Blanco syncline, the same reversed magnetization is observed in the entire 1500 m-thick sequence in volcanic and sedimentary rocks; at least part of the deformation there is thought to be Permian in age, related to the San Rafael orogenic phase (SROP). The palaeomagnetic poles are: Rinc´on Blanco (RB)
Lat. 77◦S, Long. 294◦E, N = 19, A95 = 4.9, K = 47; Chancan´ı (CH) Lat. 85◦S, Long. 359◦E,
N = 3, A95 = 8.8, K = 196; Cerro Colorado-Caminiaga (CC) Lat. 79◦S, Long. 291◦E, N = 6, A95 = 8.0, K = 71. Neither of the poles is coincident with expected Late Carboniferous–Early Permian directions according to accepted apparent polar-wander paths (APWPs) from South America and from other plates forming Pangaea in Late Palaeozoic times. This discrepancy could be the result of: (i) polar wander affecting the western Gondwana margin, probably related to SROP; (ii) tectonic rotations related to strike-slip faults active in the area since the Palaeozoic and controlling the position of the main depocentres; (iii) incorrect age assignment for the sedimentary sequences or for the remanence acquisition, i.e. local remagnetizations.

Tectonic rotations and local remagnetization have both been proven in particular localities and further work needs to be done to establish the Late Palaeozoic APWP for South America, however, SROP seems to have played a major role controlling both processes, rotation and remagnetization.

Key words: block rotations, orogeny, palaeomagnetism, remagnetization, South America, Upper Palaeozoic.

## Introduction

The poorly determined Carboniferous–Permian segment of the South American apparent polar-wander path (APWP) has played a crucial role in testing Pangaea reconstructions. The low quality and quantity of the Gondwanaland palaeomagnetic data has been repeatedly invoked as a strong limitation in assessing the Late Palaeozoic configurations for Pangaea (e.g. Van der Voo 1993). Many of the Carboniferous–Permian palaeomagnetic poles of South America
∗Corresponding author: Ciudad Universitaria, Pabell´on 2, C1428EHA Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. E-mail: geuna@gl.fcen.uba.ar have been obtained from Neopalaeozoic basins of central-western Argentina; particularly, an important set of palaeopoles are from the foreland Paganzo basin, developed east of a magmatic arc during the Late Carboniferous to Late Permian (Mpodozis & Ramos 1989; Azcuy *et al.* 1999) (Fig. 1). These poles define two distinct groups: the Late Carboniferous (Cu) group, reflecting a quasi-static period for South America, followed by the late Early Permian to Middle Jurassic (PJ) Group (Vilas 1981), with an intervening Late Carboniferous–Early Permian period of rapid polar wander. However, this geodynamic interpretation for the palaeopoles has become controversial because it is not reflected in the APWP from other plates forming Pangaea at those times (Smith 1999; McElhinny & McFadden 2000). In addition, many of these Paganzo palaeopoles

![1_image_0.png](1_image_0.png)

come from continental red beds, which has raised suspicions of remagnetization (Smith 1999), inclination error or incorrect age assignment (Rochette & Vandamme 2001). The South American Late Palaeozoic APWP is then reduced to a very small number of reliable poles (see for example Tomezzoli 2001).

We performed new palaeomagnetic studies of Upper Palaeozoic localities of the Paganzo basin, located in different tectonic settings with a range of rock types. Volcanic and coastal sedimentary rocks were sampled from both limbs of the Rincon Blanco syncline, in the ´
western extension of the basin (Fig. 2). Two additional studies were performed on small outcrops within the more stable (and poorly exposed) eastern area of the Paganzo basin.

The characteristic magnetization is exclusively of reversed polarity and pre-tectonic, and it is carried by different magnetic minerals, in a variety of lithologic types. At least part of the deformation in one of the localities is attributed to the San Rafael orogenic phase
(SROP), Asselian in age, which implies a very early acquisition of the pre-tectonic remanence. The reversed polarity suggests that rocks were magnetized during the Permian–Carboniferous reverse superchron (PCRS, ca 317 to 265 Ma; Menning 1995; Opdyke *et al.*
2000 Fig. 3), in agreement with the Late Carboniferous–Early Permian age of the sampled sections. By reviewing the Permian Paganzo poles using updated geological information, we established that localities of similar age have yielded different pole positions, forming two main groups. These groups may represent actual polar wander, with discrepancies as a result of inaccuracies in age assignations or local remagnetizations; or, they may be related to local tectonic rotations associated with strike-slip faults active in the area since the Palaeozoic (Fernandez ´ Seveso *et al.* 1990) and reactivated by Tertiary compressive tectonics in the adjacent Andean chain (Introcaso & Ruiz 2001).

Examples of both rotations and local remagnetizations are known, probably related to SROP. It seems clear that Permo-Triassic tectonic events (SROP) played a major role in the geological evolution of southern South America and its signature is usually present in the palaeomagnetic results of rock units older than Permian and close to the western margin of Gondwana.

## Geological Setting

Red beds, with scarce, thin intercalations of basaltic flows, constitute most of the Permian record in the foreland Paganzo basin.

However, this basin was open to the Pacific ocean and shallowmarine sediments were preserved in its western extension. A record of simultaneous magmatic activity and Neopalaeozoic sedimentation (Caminos 1985) is present at Rincon Blanco (7 in Fig. 2), where ´ lava flows are interbedded with shallow-marine and coastal sedimentary rocks.

A N–S trending structural high, the Protoprecordillera, partially separated the Paganzo basin from its marine extensions to the west:
the R´ıo Blanco and Calingasta-Uspallata basins (Limarino *et al.*
1996) (Fig. 2). The Paganzo basin itself can be divided into two areas: the eastern part, where the sedimentary cover is thinner and was deposited on Proterozoic igneous–metamorphic basement; and the western part, a narrow belt developed on more mobile areas, with thicker deposits upon metamorphic basement and Lower Palaeozoic sediments of the Precordillera (Azcuy *et al.* 1999). There is evidence of oblique convergence in the Late Palaeozoic subduction zone to the west (Mpodozis & Kay 1992; Kay 1993); strike-slip faults have controlled the development of the forearc basins (Fernandez Seveso ´
& Tankard 1995).

Terrigenous clastic fill of the Paganzo basin was originally subdivided into three stages referred to as Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic by Bodenbenber (1911). Azcuy & Morelli (1970) assigned the name Paganzo group to the Carboniferous–Permian sections; the Triassic sequence (usually referred to as the Upper Paganzo Section or Paganzo III in former palaeomagnetic contributions) constitutes an independent cycle related to the development of Triassic extensional basins, following a tectonic inversion marked by a major unconformity that truncates Permian sequences (Fernandez Seveso ´
& Tankard 1995).

Upper Palaeozoic fill within the Paganzo basin (i.e. the Paganzo group) comprises four supersequences of mainly continental sediments (Fig. 3): Guandacol, Tupe, Lower Patqu´ıa-De La Cuesta and Upper Patqu´ıa-De La Cuesta (Fernandez Seveso ´ *et al.* 1990). A progressive continentalization culminates in Permian supersequences composed of continental red beds with records of extensive aeolian fields.

![2_image_1.png](2_image_1.png)

Magmatic arc-related deposits in the western basin are linked with active subduction during the Late Palaeozoic, culminating in the San Rafael orogenic phase (SROP, Asselian, Llambias 1999 ).

Effects of SROP in the western margin of Gondwana are reflected in a major erosion surface on which the Choiyoi magmatic province
(280–240 Ma) developed. However, the SROP surface may not be readily identifiable where the Permian deformation is superimposed by Neogene (Andean) deformation, as in most of the western fringe of Argentina, especially where Choiyoi volcanics are absent. Recently Davila et al. (2003) showed that cylindrical folding previously attributed to Andean deformation in the Famatina system (see location in Fig. 2), in fact, reflects episodic coaxial-coplanar fold amplification, Permian deformation being one of the most important episodes recorded. The SROP effects dilute eastwards and are limited to changes in subsidence rates in the eastern foreland basins (Fernández Seveso & Tankard 1995 ).

Extensional basins developed during the Triassic and Cretaceous
(Uliana et al. 1990), after inversion at the end of the Permian. The Tertiary Andean orogeny created the present relief, in some cases by inversion of major structures and the development of tilt-block foreland basins with Neogene fill (Ramos 1999 ).

The burial depth of the Upper Palaeozoic sequences increases from east to west, as indicated by the thickness of overlying sequences and the compaction ratio. It correlates with a rise of diagenetic temperatures, as kaolinite, abundant in the eastern area, is replaced by a quartz, illite and chlorite-rich authigenic association in the west (Net 2002 ).

Permian sections of the Paganzo basin were sampled in two different settings (Fig. 2 ): two sections were located in the eastern Paganzo basin, on more stable areas of the craton, however, with limited exposures and poorly known ages. In contrast, a third section sampled in the Río Blanco depocentre is very well exposed and dated,

![3_image_0.png](3_image_0.png)

however, situated in a less stable area, closer to the Palaeozoic– Present magmatic arc. More importantly, it contains an extensive record of a unique volcanic episode coeval with sedimentation.

## Rincon Blanco Syncline ´

The R´ıo Blanco basin, a northwestern extension of the Paganzo basin (Fig. 2), has been active since the Early Carboniferous. Upper Carboniferous–Lower Permian units are clearly exposed in thick sequences, resting unconformably upon Lower Carboniferous marine sediments (Fig. 4a).

The Punta del Agua Formation (Acenolaza ˜ *et al.* 1971) is a volcano-sedimentary complex interfingered near the base of the marine sedimentary rocks of the R´ıo del Pen˜on formation (Gonz ´ alez ´ & Bossi 1986) and represents one of the few records of simultaneous magmatic activity with the Upper Palaeozoic sedimentation
(Caminos 1985). Although originally assigned to the Upper Carboniferous based on flora remains, an Early Permian age has been suggested recently, based on invertebrate fossil contents of R´ıo del Pen˜on formation (Cisterna & Sabattini 1998) and on radiometric ´
ages of 287 and 295 Myr for the uppermost andesitic flows of Punta del Agua formation (Fauque´ *et al.* 1999). According to these, the sequence would represent the Upper Carboniferous–Lower Permian transition, or the western extension of the uppermost Tupe supersequence.

The Punta del Agua Formation is composed of andesitic and basaltic flows, with minor rhyodacite flows, volcanic breccias and agglomerates. The magmatic episode consists of an intrusive facies (represented by hypabyssal basic to intermediate bodies) and an effusive one, with more acidic products constituting a laterally discontinuous intercalation in the sedimentary sequence (Fauque´
et al. 1991). Volcanic products are more abundant to the west, being replaced by volcaniclastic rocks to the east.

The R´ıo del Pen˜on Formation begins with thick conglomeratic ´
beds followed by coarse sandstones and siltstones. The sedimentary sequence is approximately 1200 m thick and it is composed of mudstones, fine sandstones and limestones, of characteristic greenish grey colour. The middle section exhibits a rich fauna constituting of brachiopods, bivalves, gastropods and ostracods. The upper section is distinguished by the presence of laminated black shales, lacking invertebrate remains.

The entire sequence was folded and is exposed now in the Rincon´
Blanco syncline. It is not clear whether the deformation was the result of the Andean orogeny (Tertiary) or to the SROP (Early Permian), however, the style of deformation, with broad folding, has led Caminos (1985), Fauque´ *et al.* (1991) and Azcuy *et al.* (1999)
to assign the deformation to the Permian.

Palaeomagnetic sampling was performed in the Rincon Blanco ´
syncline, along the Pen˜on river (Fig. 4a). One hundred and twenty ´
one hand samples were taken at 40 sampling sites, distributed over both limbs of the syncline (Fig. 4a). The Punta del Agua Formation sites were located in andesites, andesitic breccias and sandstones.

The R´ıo del Pen˜on Formation was sampled in the lower section, ´
composed of mudstones and fine to mid-grained sandstones; a 70 mthick dacitic sill intruding the lower sedimentary levels was sampled in the western limb of the syncline.

## Chancan´I

The Chancan´ı Formation outcrops in a narrow belt along the western border of the Cordoba Pampean ranges (Fig. 4b), in the footwall ´ of the reverse fault that has thrust up the Pocho and Guasapampa ranges. The unit rests unconformably on phyllites of the La Mermela Formation (Precambrian) (Fig. 4b).

Two members have been recognized within the Chancan´ı formation: the lower one (Las Aguaditas Member ) is composed of grey and greenish sandstones and mudstones and the upper one (El Cadillo Member) comprises mottled, red to pink quartz-sandstones.

The Las Aguaditas Member contains plant remains of the Late Carboniferous and the colour variation along the members led Hunicken ¨
& Pensa (1980) to correlate them with the Paganzo I and II sections
(Carboniferous Tupe and Permian Lower Patqu´ıa-De La Cuesta supersequences), respectively.

Outcrops, small and poorly exposed in a densely vegetated area, form a N–S trending asymmetric syncline, with axial plane inclined to the east (Hunicken & Pensa 1980). The thickest exposures, of ¨
2–3 m, were found in small sandstone quarries.

Three sites were obtained in the lower grey section and four in the upper red one. Just one site could be recovered in the western limb of the syncline, gently dipping to the east; the other six sites were situated in the eastern limb, steeply dipping west. In addition, three sites were located within La Mermela phyllites.

## Cerro Colorado-Caminiaga

Quartzitic red sandstones of the Cerro Colorado-Caminiaga formation (Lucero Michaut 1981) outcrop in Sierra Norte de Cordoba, ´
covering approximately 60 km2 (Fig. 4c). They are not fossiliferous, however, they have been considered temporal equivalents of the Chancan´ı Formation as a result of their lithological resemblance to the El Cadillo Member. However, the outcrops included in this unit are not homogeneous, but include a belt of grey and pink to reddish quartzitic sandstones in the east, bordering the range around Cerro Colorado, and red coarse sandstones in the west, near Caminiaga. Besides the darker colour, the latter differ from the former in being more friable and some authors have suggested that they could be younger (Cretaceous? Lucero Michaut 1981).

Oriented cylinders were drilled in a 50 m-thick outcrop in the eastern belt; the sequence here is mainly coarse-grained, however, four sites could be recovered in quartzitic mottled pink sandstones, massive or with crossed stratification. Another seven sites were obtained in the western area, near Caminiaga, five of them in friable coarse red sandstones and the remaining two in fine sandstones and brick-red mudstones.

## Laboratory Procedures Methods

At least three block samples or five core samples were taken from each site (lava flow or sedimentary bed). They were oriented using both Brunton and solar compasses whenever possible. Sedimentary units were used to determine the attitude of the sampled sections.

For palaeomagnetic measurements the samples were cut into specimens of 2.5 cm diameter and 2.2 cm length. Remanent magnetization was measured using a three-axis 2-G DC squid cryogenic magnetometer. Alternating field (AF) demagnetization was carried out to a maximum of 110 mT (peak) using a static 2G600 demagnetizer. Stepwise thermal demagnetization was performed using a Schonstedt TSD-1 thermal demagnetizer.

At least two specimens from each site were subjected to stepwise demagnetization, to examine the coercivity and blockingtemperature spectra of the natural remanent magnetization (NRM).

As a general procedure, AF demagnetization was preceded by the application of heating to 150◦C, to eliminate the effects of modern goethite, whereas thermal demagnetization was preceded by the application of low alternating fields (up to 10–20 mT) to minimize the soft components carried by multidomain magnetite. Bulk magnetic susceptibility was measured after each thermal step in order to monitor possible magnetic mineral changes.

The pilot specimens were used to determine which of the methods was the most effective for each site. At least three more specimens per site were treated to a minimum of five steps to determine the characteristic remanence magnetization (ChRM) by using principal component analysis (PCA, Kirschvink 1980).

A mean direction for each stratigraphic level was obtained by averaging magnetic components from specimens of each sedimentary bed or volcanic flow. In some cases, this procedure was performed by combining magnetic components with demagnetization circles
(McFadden & McElhinny 1988). The single-stratigraphic-level directions within each section were averaged using standard Fisher
(1953) statistics to obtain section-mean directions.

Isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) up to 4 T was applied to selected samples to identify the minerals that carry the magnetization. In addition, hysteresis and low-field thermomagnetic curves were measured at the Instituto Astronomico e Geofisico, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Hysteresis curves were measured at room temperature in a maximum field of 1 T, using a Molspin vibrating sample magnetometer; thermomagnetic curves were determined using a MS2WF furnace added to a MS2W Bartington susceptometer.

## Results Rincon Blanco ´

A total of 242 specimens (five to eight per site) were treated by alternating magnetic fields (AF) or thermal demagnetization. NRM
intensities ranged between 2 × 10−2 and 5 × 10−1 A m−1 for the volcanics, 5 × 10−3 and 4 × 10−2 A m−1 for the volcaniclastics, and between 1 × 10−5 and 4 × 10−2 A m−1 for the sedimentary rocks.

![5_image_0.png](5_image_0.png)

Volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks have magnetite as the main mineral carrier of the magnetization, with remanent coercive forces (Hcr) between 30 and 50 mT, and saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (SIRM) between 5 and 120 A m−1. However, some samples have a high-coercivity phase as the main carrier and both phases (low and high coercivity) were observed in several sites
(Fig. 5a). The dacitic sill intruded into the sedimentary R´ıo del Pen˜on Formation (site 29 in Table 1) is strongly chloritized and ´
kaolinized, and this is reflected in a very low SIRM ( ca 0.2 A m−1).

This high alteration degree seems to be restricted to the sill, while no other site showed this alteration assemblage. Characteristic hysteresis and thermomagnetic curves are shown in Figs 6(a)–(b) and 7(a)–(b), respectively.

Sedimentary rocks of the R´ıo del Pen˜on Formation are weakly ´
magnetic. Magnetic response is controlled essentially by the paramagnetic fraction. They show a slight wasp-waisted loop after paramagnetic correction, reflecting a mixture of minerals (Fig. 6c). SIRM
usually ranged between 0.05 and 0.2 A m−1 and most of the samples showed two-fraction IRM curves with a low and a high coercivity phase, interpreted as magnetite and haematite, respectively (Fig. 5b).

The latter becomes dominant in the top of the sampled sequence, which progressively reddens upwards.

Both demagnetization methods (thermal and AF) revealed two components of NRM: a component (B) removed early and coincident with the present magnetic field, and a second more stable component (A) of positive inclination (Figs 8a–f). The A component usually showed coercive forces of up to 100 mT and unblocking temperatures of 580◦C (magnetite). However, in several sites the same component showed higher unblocking temperatures, indicating that haematite is carrying the same characteristic direction (Fig. 8e). In

these cases, the directions of the magnetite and haematite components are indistinguishable.

The direction of the A component was determined with a maximum deviation angle of 10◦ in 132 specimens (55 per cent of the collection; Table 1). In another 31 specimens, the A and B components could not be completely resolved and demagnetization circles were used. The circles were combined with the remanence directions obtained in other specimens by the McFadden & McElhinny (1988)

method. The 79 remaining specimens (33 per cent of the processed specimens) did not provide stable directions. These are mainly sedimentary specimens whose magnetization intensities fell quickly below 10−7 A m−1.

The dacitic sill and its country rock recorded the same characteristic downward-inclination component as the rest of the sequence.

Unfortunately, the medium to coarse sandstones surrounding the sill carried A and B components with overlapping unblockingtemperature spectra. The precise unblocking temperature of component A in these sandstones could not be resolved by thermal demagnetization and no baked-contact test was possible.

Thirty-three sites carried an A component as a characteristic remanence, the remaining sites carrying unstable or present magnetic field (PMF) magnetization. However, an A component could be more confidently isolated in some sites by using combined minimum least squares and remagnetization circles (group 1, Table 1).

Sites named 2 in Table 1 are those with a high number of specimens discarded, or in which just demagnetization circles were used
(with no determination of reference direction by PCA). Because the Group 2 directions have a higher dispersion than Group 1, only the latter were used for the following analysis (Table 1).

Fig. 9(a) shows the directions of the A components, sites of Group 1 quality, before and after restoration to the palaeohorizontal. The fold test (McFadden & Jones 1981) is clearly positive, which indicates that the beds acquired their magnetization before they were folded. The mean direction after unfolding is Dec. 179.3, Inc. +60.8, α95 4.9 and the corresponding palaeomagnetic pole is Lat. 75◦S, Long. 291.5◦, A95 = 6.7, N = 19 [Rincon Blanco (RB) in ´
Fig. (10)].

## Chancan´I

Sixty-five standard specimens were demagnetized. NRMs usually ranged between 1.5 × 10−4 and 8 × 10−3 A m−1 for the Chancan´ı Formation, with site 1 (western limb) having the highest NRM values, between 5 × 10−3 and 2 × 10−2 A m−1.

IRM curves indicated haematite as the magnetic mineral in the red El Cadillo Member (Figs 5c and e) except for site 3, which contained goethite (Figs 5d and f) and haematite plus magnetite as carriers in the grey Las Aguaditas Member (Figs 5g–h). Thermal demagnetization of composite IRM applied along three orthogonal axes (Lowrie 1990) shows that the magnetite fraction is virtually absent in the El Cadillo Member, however, it is present in the Las Aguaditas Member (Figs 5e and h).

Demagnetization procedures on El Cadillo samples isolated a characteristic magnetic component of high unblocking temperature, between 650 and 680◦C (A), after removing a very soft component
(which will be called C) in fields lower than 10 mT (Fig. 11a). In contrast, Las Aguaditas samples carried a soft magnetic component
(C), superimposed on a very stable component that could not be successfully removed as a result of the formation of a new magnetic phase above 580◦C, as reflected in a sudden increase of the magnetic susceptibility (Figs 11b and d, Table 2).

The only site recovered in the western limb of the syncline (site 1)
showed a characteristic magnetization with negative inclination, near to the PMF direction; goethite-bearing site 3 showed unstable behaviour. Only two sites of the El Cadillo Member (sites 2 and 4) showed a remanence direction that recorded an ancient magnetic field. As for the Las Aguaditas Member, we could not determine

ChRMs decreasing towards the centre of the coordinate system, as a result of the growth of a new magnetic phase. Instead, we obtained very stable directions above 400◦C (Fig. 11b). Site 5, consisting of coarse sandstones, showed very scattered directions, and site 7
(mudstones) showed a single component with low unblocking temperatures and low coercive force (C). For all the sites, the A and C
components were roughly opposite (not antipodal) in the NW and SE quadrant of the Wulff projection, as seen in Fig. 9(b). These results are discussed below.

La Mermela phyllites unconformably underly the Chancan´ıstrata and were sampled to evaluate the possibility of remagnetization with the overlying unit. They showed a characteristic magnetic component contained in the foliation plane and near the lineation direction, isolated using either AF up to 100 mT or thermal demagnetization up to 580◦C. A second magnetic component in the direction of PMF,
presumably carried by goethite, was eliminated by 150◦C.

## Cerro Colorado-Caminiaga

Seventy one specimens were submitted to thermal demagnetization, after establishing that AF treatment was ineffective in demagnetizing the NRMs, which had intensities ranging between 3 × 10−3 and 10−1 A m−1. The characteristic magnetization in all of the samples was unblocked between 640 and 680◦C, which points to haematite as the carrier mineral of the remanence. However, Cerro Colorado sandstones showed discrete unblocking temperatures, while Caminiaga sandstones exhibited a steady decrease in intensity above 500◦C
until the final drop-out (Figs 11e–f).

Directions of characteristic magnetization were clearly distinct:
Cerro Colorado sandstones showed very low in-site dispersion, with steep positive inclinations. On the other hand, Caminiaga coarse sandstones carried more dispersed magnetizations with shallower negative inclination. Magnetic directions from the two lithologic groups are not antipodal (Fig. 9c): moreover, some of the samples from Caminiaga appear to carry a subtle high-temperature component that could not be properly isolated. Conversely, the two finegrained sites from Caminiaga showed the same positive inclination magnetization direction found in Cerro Colorado sandstones
(Fig. 9c, Table 3).

## Discussion

The positive inclination of the directions of magnetic remanence in Rincon Blanco re ´ flects a reversed polarity of the geomagnetic
