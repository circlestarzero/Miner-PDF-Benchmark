We are informed that the recently chine, and it may be inclined at different angles to bring it patented improvements have rendered the machine a marked into position for use under varying conditions. success. It is so clearly shown in the engraving that but little explanation will be required.

The main frame of the machine is about eight feet long, and the front end rest upon the $\log$ being sawed. A wedge is fastened with a hinge to the main frame, and when the log pinches the saw the wedge is turned over and driven into the saw keri The seat upon which the operator sits is capable of sufficient motion to allow the machinery to work. The operator, by pressure of the feet upon the treadles, $\mathrm{E}$, throws the saw forward; this movement is also supplemented by pulling the main lever, $D$, with the hands. $B y$ this means the saw is pro pelled with great force, a the most of the weight of the body and the strength of the arms are employed in doing the work. When the operator pushes the lever, $D$, before him, he transfers his weight from the treadles to the seat, and the latter will be pressed down; in fact, the

A NEW FIRE ESCAPE,

The fire escape ladde shown in the accompanying Mr. Joseph R. Winters, of Chambersburg, Pa. It is designed to be used both as a fire escape and a support for fire hose.

The main frame is mounted upon wheels and supports tongs, B. The screws, E, ar provided with miter wheels, which are driven by miter wheels on a shaft at the end of the main frame. On the ends of this shaft there are fly wheels, $G$, provided with cranksset diametrically oppo. site each other. A bar pivot ed to two of the lower lever of the lazytongs carries nut which travel on the screws, $\mathrm{E}$, as they are turned by the mechanism already described. The other pair of the lowe levers of the lazytongs rest upon a support that is adjustable vertically by two screws which are turned by the gearing seen below the main frame. This adjustment alter the level of the base of the ladder, and consequently varies its inclination.

Hose, C, suitable for fire purposes, extends from the fixed pipe, $\mathrm{H}$, to the top of the ladder, and is provided with nozzles One of the upper pairs of arms is longer over to receive the pulley that supports the rope from the windlass, A. This rop carries a box or basket, $D$, used for lowering goods or persons.

An improvement in bridge walls for furnaces has been patented by Mr. John Mailer, of Pacheco, Cal. The inventor places a movable 'bridge wall in a boiler furnace to contract the area of outlet from the fire surface to the boiler flues

$\mathrm{Mr}$ Henry Morrison, of Pittsburg, Pa., has patented an improved device for holding ribbon-gold while teeth are being filled, to facilitate the operation, lessen the time requred, the labor of the operator, and the exhaustion of the patient. It consists in one or more spools mounted upon rods, connected togeth er by ball-and-socket joints. and provided with a clamp for holding the device in position in the mouth.

Mrs. Henry Dormitzer, of New York city, has recently patented improvements on the window cleaning chair for which letters patent Nos. 200,441, 206.935, and 206,936 were granted to the same inventor, February 19 and Aug. present invention is to simlify the adjustment of the chair and to make it more reliable and complete. This reliable and complete. This
device, although very simple, cannot be described without engravings.

Mr. Benjamin N. Shelley, of Anderson, Ind., has invented a combined implement for domestic and other
purposes, which presents in a single device and compact form, the functions of a hammer, screw driver, corkscrew, can opener, ice pick, glass cutter and breaker, stove lifter tack drawer, saw set, knife sharpener, wrench, steak tende $\mathrm{er}_{\text {s }}$ and putty knife.

## NEW CALCULATING ATTACHMENT FOR WEIGHING SCALES.

The improved attachment for weighing scales shown in the accompanying engraving was recently patented by
Henry H. Ham, Jr., of Portsmouth, N. H. The object of the invention is to indicate the price of any number of pounds or ounces of the article being weighed.

The scales are of the usual construction, and to the base of figures cylinder upon which are placed of figures arranged in arithmetical pro-
gression, each row representing the price gression, each row representing the price
per pound or ounce of some particular per pound or ounce of some particular
article. The numbered cylinder may contain any desired number of rows of figures, and the row representing any particular class of goods may be brought opposite the slot in the casing.

The slidng weight on the scale beam is provided with an index which points to one of the numbers on the cylindrical cale. This number represents the price of the total quantity of the substance on the scale. It will be seen that this device avoids all calculating and insures accuracy.

## Carica Papaya.

Not long since notice was taken in this paper of the strong digestive power of the juce of the pawpaw, Carica papaya, used in Brazil for giving tenderness to fresh meat. Dr. Bouchut, of Paris, has been experimenting with this remarkable vegetable product, and finds that it dissolves the false membranes which form in the throat of patients suffering from croup. It is also found to kill and dissolve intestinal worms. It would appear to have noinjuriousaction upon the living mucous membrane. The pawpaw thrives in all tropical countries.

## THE OTOCYON

This animal is found in South Africa and in parts of East Africa, generally upon the bushy highlands near the rivers. It is about three feet in length from the tip of the nose to the end of the tail, the tail being about one-third of the entire
length. The ears are enormous, entirely disproportionate to the rest of the animal. The eyes aresharp, the nose pointed, the legs are of good length. It sleeps during the day and goes out for its prey in the night. It lives on small animals and upon grasshoppers. The natives hunt it down for its fur and even eat its fiesh, although it has a very offensive taste.

## A Horse Crazed with Tea.

Lord William Beresford, in addition to his distinction as a gallant and chivalrous soldier, will ke distinguished in history as the owner of a horse which was poisoned by tea. The Veterinary Journal reports the "case," and characterizesit as " unparalleled in the annals of veterinary or even human toxicology." A staff cook having left some pounds of tea in a sack, a Kaffir groom filled it with corn, and serving out the contents to a troop of horses, gave Lord William Beresford's charger the bulk of the tea, which was eaten greedily, and produced the most startling results. The animal plunged and kicked, and ran backwards, at intervals gal loping madly around, finally falling into a donga, where it lay dashing its head on the rocks, and was dispatched by an assegai thrust through the heart. The post-mortem appearances indicated extreme cere bral congestion. The occurrence as an accident is probably unique. The phenomena exhibited were, however, characteristic of the action of caffeine-namely, cerebral excitement, with partial loss of sensibili ty, convulsions; and death. The sensory nerves are paralyzed without any corresponding paralysis of the motor nerves, so that the mus cular action, which proceeds from ideation and volition, remains un

its middle to form a loop or bail, and having its arms parallel and connected by cross rods, and supporting tubes which carry harrow knives of peculiar form.

## NATURAL HISTORY NOTES

Relations of Flowers and Insects.-For some years pastsince the publication of Darwin's researches-we have bee accustomed to look on the forms, colors, perfumes, and nec tar-like secretions of fiowers as so many adaptations and contrivances to secure the visits of insects, and the conse quent fertilization of the fiower. Recently, however, an these otbers. M. Gaston Bonnier, after having observed durin the last seven years some 800 plants in various parts of Europe, comes to the fol Towing conclusions, the details upon which he founds them being given in recent numbers of the Annales des Sciences Naturelles and of the Bulletin of the Botanical Society of France

"1. The development of colors in flowers has no relation to the development of nectar. In closely allied species of the same genus, the most conspicuous fiowers are not those which are most visited by insects.

" 2. In di≈ìcious fiowers provided with nectar the insects do not visit first the male and afterwards the female fiower.

" 6 . Bees become accustomed to colors but as much so to those which are incon spicuous as to those which are brilliant For the same weight of boney a green sur face is as freely visited as a green surface with a background of red.

" 4 . The development of spots and stripes on the corolla has no relation to the production of nectar."

M. Bonnier, who has studied the anato$\mathrm{my}$ and disposition of the nectar-secreting organs in a great number of plants, point out that these accumulations of saccha

An improved machine or apparatus to be mounted on a low beam for sowing and distributing seeds and fertilizers as been patented by Mr. William G. Humphreys, of Pendlen, S. C. Any two kinds of seeds, such as corn and bean rease, which are of ten sown together, can with this mahine be sown at the same time. Corn and guano, cotton eed and mineral phosphate, or any seed and fertilizer can be.sown with accuracy at one and the-same time, or in quick frrow in advance of the sowing

This is an im rovement in harvesters whose platforms are made vertically rine material occur usually in parts of the plant where deve lopment is going on actively, as in young leaves or young ovaries. When the emission of liquid ceases, the saccharine matters contained in the nectaries return into the plant, and are probably used up by the neighboring parts in the course of this development. In fact, the nectaries whether fioral or extra-fioral, whether they excrete liquid or ot, act as reservoirs of nutriment which is in direct relaion to the life of the plant.

Vegetable "Commensalism."-I wonder, says Mr. J. E Taylor, whether botanists will ultimately discover that certain plants are "commensal," as well as certain animals such as Prof. Van Beneden has told us about in his "Ani mal Messmates." For several years past, I have been particularly struck by the occurrence in the eastern counties (of England) of the yellow wort (Chlora perfoliata) so constantly in company with the bee orchis (Ophrys a pifera), that when I have found one plant I have almost instinctively looked for the other. Has this associatio been noted elsewhere? It seems pos sible to imagine that flowers gener ally obscure should reap some ad vantage by growing in the neigh borhood of more attractive kind (although the bright yellow wor hardly needs to associate with the bee orchis on that account), just as you see little confectioners' booth springing up by the side of the itine rant circus, in order to profit by the greater attraction of the noisy ex hibition. Again, I conceive it possible that other flowers may be ad vantaged in quite a different way, by growing in company with plant possessing some poisonous, stinging or other defensive property. Thus, it is noticeable how certain kinds of umbelliferous flowers are always found growing in the midst of dens patches of nettles, or amid the thorny brambles and hedge rows Have any of our botanical readers noticed anything approaching such "commensalism" as here suggested?

Multiplication of Weeds.-It has been found, says the American Agriculturist, by careful and patient counting of the number of perfect seeds produced in a number of seed pods, and then counting the number of mature pods, that on affected. The reversal of limb movements, which produce they are hinged. It consists in a peculiar arrangement of single plant of purslane (Portulaca oleracea) there will be running backwards in quadrupeds, is a common symptom of parts for raising and lowering the platform without chang. brain disturbance, frequently witnessed, for example, in the ing its horizontal angle.
