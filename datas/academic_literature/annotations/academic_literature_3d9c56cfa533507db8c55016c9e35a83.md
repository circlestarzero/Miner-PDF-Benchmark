# Abstract 

Six highbush blueberries were introduced Into New Zealand from North America 1n 1950. A further introduction of 10 cultivars was made in 1973.

Development of the industry has been rapid since 1975. There are currently more than 400 ha planted, compr1sing 4 main cultivars. Production in 1983 was 150 tonnes, with a marked peak during late December to mid-January.

Research concentrated on plant propagation and selection during the industry establishment phase. Recently, emphasis has been placed on evaluation of berry characteristics, yleld and fruit season of a range of cultivars. Frult slze and.yleld have important implications in relation to volume of exportable fruit. Fruit season influences are reflected in market opportunities.

Frui: production and berry sizes in New Zealand compare more than favourably with Northera Hemisphere experience. Cultivar Dixi, for example, 11 years from planting, produced $12.6 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{plant}$, average berry $812 e 1.68$. Season of all cultivars is influenced by latitude.

Present research programmes on blueberries in New Zealand cover a wide range of management activities.

## History of Blueberry Industry in New Zealand

Highbush (Vaccinium corymboswn L.) and Rabbiteye (Vaccinium ashei Keade) blueberries were first introduced into New Zealand in 1950. Initial plantings were made of 6 highbush cultivars (Atlantic, Burlington, Concord, Dixi, Jersey and Stanley), and 3 rabbiteye cultivars (Calloway, Clara and Meyers), in consolidated peat. Growth and berry production of highbush cultivars was sufficiently encouraging for further plantings to be made in 1965. Planting of rabbiteye cultivars was not expanded.

Introductions of a further 10 highbush cultivars, Berkeley, Bluecrop, Blue Ray, Collins, Coville, Darrow, Early Blue, Herbert, Ivanhoe and Rubel, were made in 1973, as well as the rabbiteye cultivars Garden Bive, Tif Blue and Woodard (Van der Elst, 1978). At present 40 cultivars have been imported either by Government Research Stations or by private growers (Lund, 1980).

Development of the New Zealand blueberry Industry was slow. UntiI 1975 there were only 2 ha of commercial plantings in the North Island of New Zealand. Rapid development of the Industry has taken place since. By 1979,14 ha of blueberries were planted; by 1981 the area

Increased to $259 \mathrm{ha} ;$ presently 400 ha have been established (Pranklin, pers. com. 1984). At least $68 \%$ of plantings are in the Waikato district (Figure 1) of the North Island (Langford, 1982).

The New Zealand industry is based primarily on 4 North American highbush cultivars, Atlantic (26\%), Jersey (24\%), Dixi (20\%), and Burlington (197). Other cultivars in commercial plantings are Stanley, Herbert, Blue Ray, Berkeley, Early Blue, Collins, Rubel, Darrow and the rabbiteye T1f Blue (Langford, 1982).

Production has risen steadily from 18 tonnes in 1973 to 150 tonnes in 1983, of which 73 tonnes was exported. The main markets for New Zealand fruit are USA (63\%), EEC (20\%), and Australia (12.5\%) (Langford, 1982).

The industry appears to be entering a consolidation phase. Rate of expansion of plantings is decreasing. Projections are for 2,050 tonnes of fruit by $1987 / 88$ (Langford, 1982).

The major research effort on blueberries in New Zealand is carried out at Ruakura Soll \& Plant Research Station in the Waikato. Early work was concentrated on propagation methods and selection of cultivars. Selection criterla were sultability for machine harvesting, and productivity (Van der Elst, 1978). Only two selections made in these early programes, 'A9' (a selection from cultivar Jersey), and 'Cll' (a selection from cultivar Stanley) are grown comercially.

During the late 19708 and early 1980 s, research has expanded to cover a range of production-related topics. Programes include chemical weed control (James, 1980; Rahman et al., 1982), chemical blrd repellants (Bolland et a1., 1980, 1981; Sorrenson and Holland, 1981), effects of mycorrbizal fungl on growth in both mursery and field plants (Powell and Bates, 1981; Powell, 1982), pruning (Poll, 1983), selection of early season cultivars (Poll and Wood, 1983), harvesting requirements (Poll, 1981), processing uses (Poll and Wood, 1983), mechantsed grading, control of fruit season using ripening agents, evaluation of cultivars for productIvity, production season and frult quality (Poll and Wood, 1982, 1983).

## Productivity of Blueberries in New Zealand

The performance and characteristics of blueberriea in New Zealand is best described from three trials. These were designed to provide comparisons between North American highbush cultivars under New Zealand conditions, and to enable evsluation of some local selections. Prom Information galned on frult season, fruit characteristics and product1vity, it is now possible to provide guidance for future plantings to maximise profitability for New Zealand blueberty growers.

The first two trials were planted on virgin peat, pH 3.8. Fertiliser (4:1:1 - serpentine superphosphate:sulphate of amonia:sulphate of potash) was applled in October each year at $25 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{p}$ lant for the first 3 years, $75 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{p}$ lant for years 3 to 6 , and $100 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{p}$ lant from year 7. Additional sulphate of ammonta at $25 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{plant}$ was applied in November each year. Funglcide and pestlcide spray schedules were matntalned in accordance with export regulations. Low brancies and old non-productive branches were pruned out to maintain an open structure for ease of picking and to maximise sunlight penetration.

In the third trial, growth and production of selected indicator cultivars was monitored in several districts.

Trial. 1: Comparison of standard h1ghbush blueberry cultivars and early New Zealand select1ons.

## Method

Four seed1ing select1ons (coded A9, D14, C11 and A16), and 3 named

replicates of 3 plants per cultivar in randomised blocks. Inter-row spacing was $3.6 \mathrm{~m}$, and between-plant spacing was $0.6 \mathrm{~m}$ ( 4630 p1ants/ha). Four years after establishment, plant population was reduced by one plant per plot to 3086 plants/ha. A further reduction of one plant per plot was carried out 3 years later as bushes reached maturity, resulting in a final plant population of 1543 plants/ha. Fruft weights were recorded from $1976 / 77$ each season (3r years from field planting) unt1I 1983/84. For the $1981 / 82$ and $1982 / 83$ harvests, average berry weights and percent fruit soluble sol1ds, were recorded. Average berry weights were determined from 100 berries sampled at random at each harvest. Percent soluble sollds was measured using a hand-held refractometer and extract from 10 berries sampled at random at each harvest.

## Results and D1scussion

Yields obtalned for standard cultivars compared favourably with those recorded in Northern Hemisphere countrles (D1jkstra, 1977; Llebster and Sch1umelpfeng, 1977; Lamb, 1977; Eck and Childers, 1969). Accumulative total yield per ha over 8 seasons ranged from 73.9 t/ha for Al6, to $119.3 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{ha}$ for Dix1 (Table 1).

Increase in yleld over the first 4 years from close planting, ranged from $22.5 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{ha}$ for $\mathrm{Al} 6$, to $34.4 \mathrm{t} / \mathrm{he}$ for A9. Additional production from close planting over the flrst 4 production seasons $=\left[(Y \times 3)+\left(\Sigma Y_{2-4} \times 2\right)\right]-$ $\left(Y_{1}+\sum Y_{2-k}\right)$, were $Y_{1}=$ first yield per plant, and $\sum Y_{2} \rightarrow$ total yleld of second, th1rd and fourth year product1on per plant (Table 1), expressed as tonnes per hectare. Depending on the cost of plant material as well as labour requirements for intial planting and subsequent removal of plants in later years, extra income could be gained from Init1al high plant densitfes. Average berry weights measured in 2 seasons ranged from $0.9 \mathrm{~g}$ for $A 9$ and up to $1.6 \mathrm{~g}$ for D1z1. Soluble solids varied between harvest within variety; the highest was recorded for A9 (13.3\%), and lowest for Jersey ( $11.5 \pi$ ).

Ir1al_2: Perforwance of 14 highbush cultiv̀ars.

## Method

'Fourteen highbush cultivars (Dixi, Herbert, Berkeley, Blue Ray, Bluecrop, Darrow, Rubel, Stanley, Jersey, Early Blue, Collins, Ivanhoe, Covilie and Atlant1c) were planted in 1978. S1x replicates of each cultivar, inter-row spacing 4 w and Intra-row spacing $1.75 \mathrm{~m}$ ( 1428 plants/ ha), were planted in randomised blocks. Ylelds were recorded for each plant from $1979 / 80$ season. Average berry welghts were measured at each harvest from $1981 / 82$.

## Results and Discussion

The late-maturing cultivars Dixi and Berbert consistently produced higher per-plant yields than the early-maturing tultivars Early Blue and Collins (Table 2). Performance of North Amel:ican highbush cultivars in this trial compares favourably with produc:1on recorded in North America (Table 3). S1milarly, fruit sizes were equivalent to or higher than those reported by Moore, 1970; Moore et al., 1972, Liebster and Schimmelpfeng, 1977, but lower than those reported by Nelson, 1982. Average berry weights ranged from 2.18 for Darruw, down to 1.08 for Rubel.

Trial 3: Fruit season of 3 cultivars in four North Isiand Districts.

Method

Production was monftored for an early cultivar (Rarly Blue), a midseason cultivar (Atlantlc), and a late cultivar (D1xi), in four districts in the North Island of New Zealand: Northland (northern North Island); Watkato/Bay of Plenty (central North Island); Taranak1 (south western North Island), and Borowhenua (southern North Island).

## Results and D1scussion

Results for the $1982 / 83$ season show clearly that ripening is affected by latitude (Figure 1). These regional influences are of significance In planning the future development of the fresh frult export industry. At present the bulk of fruit ripens from late December until late January. This has been identified as a difficult marketing period. By structuring plantings, the season in each region can be extended, and the impact of post-Christras market depression minimised.

## CONCLUSIONS

A preference for large berries on international markets is reported by New Zealand exporters. On the basis of berry slze, Darrow, Berkeley, Ivanhoe, Collins, Herbert, Early Blue, Coville and DLxi are the most suttable cultivars for fresh export. Of these cultivars, those which fruit during the wost desirable production season for Waikato/Bay of Plenty districts in New Zealand are Herbert, Darrow, D1xI, Early Blue and Collins.

Further trials are needed to evaluate production seasons of more recent introductions, and to assess productivity of new early and late selections. These will increase the range of early and late cultivars avallable for grovers to maximise production during the most profitable periods for the New Zealand industry.
