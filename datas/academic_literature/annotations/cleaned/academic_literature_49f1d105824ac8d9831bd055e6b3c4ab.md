#### Abstract

The predominant histopathologic feature of inflammatory bowel disease is the infiltration of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, in the affected intestine. Helicobacter pylori is recognized as the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal lesions, and Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis is characterized by increased numbers of acute and chronic inflammatory cells. The pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease or Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis involves immunological abnormalities, including the deficient or excessive expression of cytokines. The chronic inflammatory process in patients with Crohn's disease may affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, whereas ulcerative colitis affects mainly the colon and rectum. Here, we discuss abnormalities in the upper gastrointestinal tract in inflammatory bowel disease. Although the prevalence rate of Helicobacter pylori infection is low in Crohn's disease, these patients often have abnormalities in the upper gastrointestinal tract.

## Introduction

The predominant histopathologic feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the infiltration of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes, into the affected intestine (Hart et al., 2005; Giampaolo et al., 2006). Although the immunological abnormality in both forms of IBD, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is still not precisely known, deficient or excessive expression and response of cytokines are almost[^0]

certainly involved (Sartor, 1994; Fiocchi, 1998). Cytokines are produced by a variety of immune and non-immune cells including monocytes/macrophages, T cells, B cells, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells, platelets, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and bone marrow stromal cells. Some cytokines activate or regulate inflammatory cells such as monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and mast cells, while others are involved in the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of lymphocytes, acting as soluble mediators of immune systems (Burke et al., 1993).

Crohn's disease has been identified in all parts of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to anus, whereas ulcerative colitis mainly involves the colon and rectum (Fiocchi, 2002). Involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract in IBD is considered characteristic of Crohn's disease (Casellas et al., 2005; Knapp et al., 2005; Lemberg et al., 2005; Moriyama et al., 2005; Remes-Troche et al., 2006). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is recognized as the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal lesions (Marshall and Warren, 1984; Marshall et al., 1988; Blaser, 1992; Walsh and Peterson, 1995), and H. pylori-associated gastritis is characterized by increased numbers of acute and chronic inflammatory cells (Mizuno et al., 2005; Suzuki et al., 2004). The H. pylori infection status of IBD patients with upper gastrointestinal lesions should be checked to distinguish an IBD- or H. pylori infection-related pathogenesis.

Here, we review upper gastrointestinal lesions in Crohn's disease patients from the standpoint of $H$. pylori infection status, endoscopic and histopathological findings, and immunological abnormalities.

## Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in IBD

Several studies have found a significantly lower prevalence of H. pylori infection in IBD patients than in normal individuals (Table 1) (El-Omar E et al., 1994; Halme et al.,

Table 1. Prevalence rate of $H$. pylori infection in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease

|  | H. pylori-positive ratios |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Paper | Year | IBD | Controls |
| El-Omar et al. | 1994 | $22 \%$ | $52 \%$ |
| Halme et al. | 1996 | $15 \%$ | $43 \%$ |
| Wagtmans et al. | 1997 | $12 \%$ (Crohn's disease) | $35 \%$ |
| Piodi et al. | 2003 | $47 \%$ | $61 \%$ |

1996; Wagtmans et al., 1997; Piodi et al., 2003). The reason for this inverse correlation between $H$. pylori infection and IBD is not clear. One admittedly controversial possibility is that long-term treatment with sulphasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) may lead to eradication (El-Omar et al., 1994; Piodi et al., 2003). Against this, Halme et al. reported that the difference is explained by neither medical treatment nor socio-economic factors (Halme et al., 1996). Subjective symptoms did not predict the presence of endoscopic lesions or H. pylori infection in IBD patients (D'Inca et al., 1998). Although chronic gastritis and duodenitis are common in Crohn's disease patients (Casellas et al., 2005; Knapp et al., 2005; Lemberg et al., 2005; Moriyama et al., 2005; RemesTroche et al., 2006), we speculate that the majority of cases are not associated with $H$. pylori infection.

## Upper gastrointestinal endoscopic and histopathological findings in Crohn's disease (Table 2)

The upper gastrointestinal tract is frequently involved in Crohn's disease, with incidence reported to range from $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ (Dancygier and Frick, 1992; Alcantara et al., 1993). Diagnosis of Crohn's disease here is based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histologic features. Among Crohn's disease patients who are H. pylori-negative, gastric lesions occur predominantly in the gastric antrum as nonspecific endoscopic findings such as granular mucosa, patchy erythema, aphthous erosions and verrucous lesions (Dancygier and Frick, 1992). One peculiar finding in the Crohn's-affected stomach is referred to as 'bamboo joint-like appearance (BJA)', which is characterized by subtle furrows intersecting

the swollen folds coursing longitudinally in the gastric body and cardia (Yokota et al., 1997).

Representative findings of duodenal involvement in Crohn's disease include aphthous erosions, longitudinal ulcers, cobblestone appearance, polypoid lesions, and a notched appearance (Lenaerts et al., 1989; Nugent and Roy, 1989; Cameron, 1991; van Hogezand et al., 2001). Histologically, Crohn's disease lesions are typically encountered as granulomas and multinucleated giant cells in surgical specimens (Haggitt and Meissner, 1973) or biopsy samples taken at the time of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Schmitz-Moormann et al., 1985; Korelitz et al., 1981). Focally enhanced gastritis is more often detected on biopsies of the upper gastrointestinal tract in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis than H. pylori-related gastritis (Sharif et al., 2002). We immunohistochemically studied biopsy specimens from the duodenum of Crohn's disease patients, and found that CD68positive cells were prominent among infiltrating mononuclear cells (Fig. 1). These characteristic findings did not change after eradication of $H$. pylori in patients with Crohn's disease.

CD68-positive cells, which are macrophages, may play a key role in the immunological abnormalities occurring in the duodenum in Crohn's disease patients.

As for the treatment of upper gastrointestinal lesions in Crohn's disease, corticosteroids, sulphasalazine, and 5-ASA remain the most important drugs. Adjunctive therapy with gastric antisecretory drugs and mucosal protective agents, for example, is sometimes beneficial. Endoscopic evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract with biopsy should be part of the work-up in Crohn's disease patients.

## Mucosal proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in upper gastrointestinal lesions in Crohn's disease

The bulk of our knowledge on the mechanisms of IBD has come from immunology (Fiocchi, 2002). Immunological studies are dominated by cytokines, chemokines and other soluble factors, and have shown how different anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory mediators are improperly regulated and how immune imbalance can be restored. In Crohn's disease, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1beta and IL-8 are to some degree up-regulated even in clinically uninvolved segments (Sher et al., 1995; Daig et al., 1996). Immunological abnormalities may also be involved in the upper gastrointestinal lesions of Crohn's disease. Moriyama et al. assessed mucosal proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in gastroduodenal lesions of Crohn's disease (Moriyama et al., 2005); although they reported no differences in IL-1beta, IL-8 and RANTES in cardial and duodenal mucosa between patients and controls, they did find that duodenal mucosal levels of IL-1beta and IL-8 were significantly higher in positive than negative duodenal lesions, but no such difference in cardial lesions. The pathogenesis of Crohn's disease lesions may differ between the stomach and duodenum.

## Conclusion

The prevalence rate of $H$. pylori infection is low in patients with IBD. However, upper gastrointestinal tract inflammation is a common finding in these patients, especially among those with Crohn's disease. These lesions may result from immunological abnormalities in the duodenum. Further investigation of the upper gastrointestinal tract in IBD patients is required to clarify the pathogenesis of IBD.
