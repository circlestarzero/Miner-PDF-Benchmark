## 课堂测验

## 测验题

The players $\qquad$ from the whole country are expected to bring us honor in this summer game.
A selecting
B to select
selected
having selected

## 课堂测验

## 答案

C

## 解析

根据句意, the players 和 select 是被动的关系, 应该用过去分词作后置定语表被动。故正确答案为 $\mathrm{C}$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

Look over there - there's a very long, winding path $\qquad$ up to the house.
A leading
B leads
C led
D to lead

## 课堂测验

## 答案

A

## 解析

path 和 lead 构成逻辑上的主动关系, 所以用现在分词形式, 故正确答案为 $A$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

your own needs and styles of communication is as important as learning to convey your affection and emotions.

A Understanding

Being understood
B To be understood

D Having understood

A

本题主要考查非谓语动词。

本句为主系表结构， $\qquad$ your own needs and styles of communication 为主语, 应填 understand 的非谓语形式。结合题意, 本题是将主语和表语进行对比,强调二者同样重要, 其结构应类似, 因此主语采用动名词 understanding 即可。 B项为不定式的被动形式，且不定式强调动作尚未发生，句中并没有体现任何表示被动的意思，也没有体现动作尚未发生，故错误;

C项为现在分词的被动式, understand 与 your own needs 之间是动宾关系, 应用表主动的非谓语形式，因此C项错误；

D项为现在分词的完成式, 强调分词表示的动作发生在谓语动词动作之前, 不符合题

## 测验题

In many people's opinion, that company, though relatively small, is pleasant $\qquad$
A to deal with

B dealing with

C to be dealt with

D dealt with

## 课堂测验

## 答案

A

## 解析

本题考查不定式的用法

一些形容词后经常用不定式的主动形式表被动。本题中, company 与 deal with 之间构成动宾关系，此时需要用不定式的主动形式来表示被动含义。故正确答案为 $A$ 。

## 课堂测验

## 测验题

The film star wears sunglasses. Therefore, he can go shopping without $\qquad$ .

A recognizing

B being recognized

C having recognized

D having been recognized

## 课堂测验

## 答案

B

## 解析

本题主要考查动词的时态和语态。

分析题干意思 “电影明星戴着太阳镜。这样，他去购物就可以不被认出来了” 可知,此处需要选择表示被动的选项, 故排除A、C项; D项是表示完成, 与题意不符, 故排除。without 是介词, 后面要用名词或动名词形式, 因此 being recognized 符合题意。故正确答案为 $B$ 。



$\square$ Topic: People

## Reading

## People

(1) Suppose(假设) you become a leader in an organization(组织 ；机构). It's very likely that you'll want to have volunteers to help with the organization's activities. To do so, it should help to understand why people undertake(承担；从事) volunteer work and what keeps their interest in the work.

(2) Let's begin with the question of why people volunteer. Researchers have identified(识别；发现） several factors that motivate(激励)people to get involved(参与). For example, people volunteer to express personal values related to unselfishness(无私), to expand their range of experiences, and to strengthen(加强) social relationships. If volunteer position do not meet these needs, people may not wish to participate. To select volunteers, you may need to understand the motivations of the people you wish to attract.

## People

(3) People also volunteer because they are required to do so.

To increase levels of community service, some school have launched(开展)compulsory(强制性的; 义务的) volunteer programs. Unfortunately, these programs can shift(改变) people's wish of participation from an internal factors (e.g., "I volunteer because it's important to me") to an external factor (e.g., "I volunteer because I'm required to do so"). When that happens, people become less likely to volunteer in the future. People must be sensitive to this possibility when they make volunteer activities a must(必须做的事).

(4) Once people begin to volunteer, what leads them to remain in their positions over time? To answer this question, researchers have conducted(实施) follow-up(后续的) studies in which they track volunteers over time. For instance, one study followed 238 volunteers in Florida over a year. One of the most important factors that influenced their satisfaction as volunteers was the amount of suffering(痛苦) they experienced in their volunteer positions. Although this result may not surprise you, it leads to(导致) important practical advice. The researchers note(发现) that attention should be given to "training methods that would prepare volunteer for troublesome situations or provide them with strategies for coping with(处理) the problem they do experience".

## People

(5) Another study of 302 volunteers at hospital in Chicago focused on individual differences in the degree(程度) to which people view "volunteer" as an important social role. It was assumed(假设；认为) that those people for whom the role of volunteer was most part of their personal identity would also be most likely to continue volunteer work. Participants indicated(指出；表明) the degree to which the social role matter by responding to statements(陈述) such as "Volunteering in Hospital is an important part of who I am". Consistent with( 与 ... - 致 ) the researchers' expectations, they found a positive correlation(正相关) between the strength of role identity and the length of time people continued to volunteer.

## People

These results, once again, lead to concrete(具体的) advice. "Once an individual begins volunteering, continued efforts might focus on developing a volunteer role identity ... Items like T-shirts that allow volunteers to be recognized publicly for their contributions can help strengthen role identity." (15 江苏卷C)
