Purified DNA polymerase from AMV was exposed to thermal inactivation in the presence and absence of various compounds required for maximal activity. A synergistic protective effect was noted when all the components were present. The enzyme showed a distinct preference for primed templates, especially for its native 70 S RNA. Heat inactivation studies also suggested that the active sites for RNase $H$ and that for the polymerase were not identical.

It is well established that AMV DNA polymerase may initiate transcription of viral 70S RNA utilizing either a naturally occurring RNA or a synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide as a primer (1). As with most other DNA polymerases, the enzyme cannot synthesize DNA chains de novo using a single stranded template alone, since a $3^{\prime}-\mathrm{OH}$ containing primer molecule is required for initiation of synthesis. Thus addition of the primer oligo dT to AMV 70S RNA resulted in a six-fold stimulation in the template activity of the RNA (2), probably because of priming of the poly rA tract in the 70S RNA molecule (3). We have recently reported chemical modification of adenosine residues in poly rA (4) and AMV 70S RNA which resulted in their inactivation as templates (2). The modified 70S RNA was also found to completely inhibit the transcription of unmodified 70S RNA. By contrast, inhibition was not observed when oligo dT primed $70 S$ RNA was used as the template-primer, suggesting a preference by the enzyme for transcription of oligo dT primed regions of the $70 S$ RNA (2). These initial observations prompted us to investigate further the effects of priming naturally occurring or synthetic templates on polymerase

recognition. We have used heat inactivation of the polymerase in the presence or absence of its substrates as a means to evaluate the effect of template priming. We have also determined the kinetics of thermal inactivation of RNase H activity in an attempt to show whether the polymerizing and nuclease activities reside at the same catalytic site or share common elements for their respective sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reagents: Unlabeled and labeled triphosphates were obtained from Schwarz/Mann Bioresearch, specific activities (Ci/mmole) were ; dTTP, 17.3; dATP, 20; dCTP, 30; dGTP, 20; UTP. 12. Whatmann phosphocel1ulose, P-11 was from H. Reeve Angel, Inc. Calf thymus DNA was obtained from Worthington Biochemicals and "activated" calf thymus DNA was prepared by limited DNase I digestion as described (5). All synthetic polynucleotides used were obtained from Collaborative Research.

Virus: Avian Myeloblastosis Virus (AMV) was obtained from the plasma of infected chicks provided through contract NO1CP33291 within the virus Cancer program of the National Cancer Institute. The virus was concentrated and purified as described ( 6 ).

Enzymes: AMV DNA polymerase was assayed essent1ally as described (7). The reaction mixture contalned in a final volume of $0.1 \mathrm{ml}$ : $50 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris-HC1 ( $\mathrm{pH} 8.3$ ), $6 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MgCl}_{2}$, $0.4 \mathrm{mM}$ dithiothreitol, $50 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}, 0.2 \mathrm{mK}$ each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP $0.125 \mathrm{mM}_{-} 3_{\mathrm{H}_{-}}^{-}-\operatorname{TTP}(80-300 \mathrm{cpm} / \mathrm{pmole})$, (dT) ${ }_{12-18}$ and $70 \mathrm{~S}$ RNA as designated in the appropriate Tables and Figures. The ol1go (dT) ${ }_{12-18:}$ 70S RNA ratio was $1: 5$ by weight. Reactions were incubated at $37^{\circ}$ for 30 minutes and stopped by transfer to $4^{\circ}$. To each reaction $0.2 \mu \mathrm{g}$ bovine serum albumin, $0.2 \mu \mathrm{g}$ yeast RNA and 10 umoles pyrophosphate were added followed by cold trich1oroacetic acid to final concentration of $10 \%$. After allowing the reaction mistures to incubate for 10 minutes at $4^{\circ}$, acid insoluble material was collected on Whatmann GF/C filters. Filters were washed with $10 \%$
trichloracetic acid and the radioactivity was counted, Transcription of $70 \mathrm{~S}$ RN both in the absence and presence of oligo dT was dependent upon the presence of all four deoxytriphosphates. Omission of dCTP or dGTP reduced DNA synthesis by 80 percent indicating that the TMP incorporation involved heteropolymer DNA formation and not transcription of only the poly rA region of $70 \mathrm{SN}$ R. The product of the reaction was alkali and RNase stable but sensitive to DNase.

The purified fraction of AMV DNA polymerase showed two distinct bands in SDS gel electrophoresis, representing the two non-identical subunits. Purified enzyme with a specific activity of 850 units/ug of protein as defined by Kacian et. al. (7) was used for all subsequent studies.

Preparation of $70 \mathrm{~S}$ AMV RNA: High molecular weight $70 \mathrm{R}$ RNA from AMV was extracted (8), and layered onto linear sucrose gradients of $5-30 \%$ (w/w/) in $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaCl}$, $0.01 \mathrm{M}$ Tris ( $\mathrm{pH} 7.3$ ) and $0.001 \mathrm{M}$ EDTA. Centrifugation was performed for 3 hours at $105,000 \mathrm{x} g$. Fractions were collected and precipitated with ethanol. External markers used were $28 \mathrm{~S}$ and $18 \mathrm{~S}$ : $_{\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{H}}}$ RNA from $\mathrm{NC}-37$ cells.

Chemical modification of 70 S RNA with chloroacetaldehyde:

Chloroacetaldehyde was prepared by hydrolysis of its dimethylacetal (Aldrich) in dilute sulfuric acid, and the liberated aldehyde was collected by distillation (9). The pH of the distillate was adjusted to 7.4 with KOH and was stored at $-20^{\circ}$.

Modification of adenine residues of $70 \mathrm{SN} \Omega$ was carried out by incubating the RNA in the presence of chloroacetaldehyde, $\mathrm{pH} 4.5(0.01-0.1 \mathrm{M})$ at $37^{\circ}$ for one hour. Samples were lyophilized to remove the reagent. Preparation of poly $d T$ poly $\left[{ }^{3} \mathrm{H}\right]$ rA: The hybrid was synthesized in a reaction mixture of $0.05 \mathrm{ml}$ containing: $40 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris. $\mathrm{HCl}$ ( $\mathrm{pH} 7.8$ ); $1 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MnCl}_{2} ; 100 \mu g$ poly dT; $0.1 \mathrm{mM}\left[{ }^{3} \mathrm{H}\right]$ ATP ( $20 \mathrm{Ci} / \mathrm{mM}$ ); $1 \mathrm{mM}$ dithiothreitol; $50 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of E. coli DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Incubation was carried out at $37^{\circ}$ for $30 \mathrm{~min}$ and reactions were stopped by addition of $20 \mu 1(10 \% \mathrm{SDS}), 50 \mu 1(4 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaCl})$ and

$2 \mathrm{ml}$ of ethanol. The resulting precipitates were centrifuged at $10,000 \times g$ for $30 \mathrm{~min} .$, then resuspended in $0.3 \mathrm{ml} 0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaCl}$ and $0.01 \mathrm{M}$ Tris$\cdot$HCl $\mathrm{pH} 7.9$, and extracted with a solution containing equal volumes of phenol and chloroform: isoamylalcohol (24:1). The material in the aqueous phase was concentrated by ethanol precipitation and then passed through a 1 x $25 \mathrm{~cm}$ column of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 0.01 M Tris.HC1

Assay of ribonuclease $H$ : Assays were carried out in $25 \mu 1$ containing the following: $8 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris $\mathrm{HCl}$ ( $\mathrm{pH} 7.8$ ); $7 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{MnCl}_{2} ; 5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml} \mathrm{BSA} ; 0.25 \mathrm{mM}$ EDTA; $2 \mathrm{mM}$ mercaptoethanol; $40 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{NaCl}$ and AMV polymerase. The concentration of the hybrid poly dT poly $\left[3_{\mathrm{H}}\right]$ rA was $23 \mu \mathrm{gs} / \mathrm{ml}$. Incubation was carried out at $37^{\circ}$ for 1 hour and showed linearity. The reaction was stopped by the addition of $100 \mathrm{~kg}$ BSA and $0.5 \mathrm{ml} 10 \% \mathrm{TCA}$. After $15 \mathrm{~min}$. at $4^{\circ}$ the mixture was centrifuged for $15 \mathrm{~min}$. at $10,000 \mathrm{x}$ and $0.2 \mathrm{ml}$ of the supernantant fraction was counted.

Heat inactivation of AMV DNA polymerase: A1iquots ( 5 â¿²1) of AMV DNA polymerase were added to a solution which contained the required components. The mixture in a total volume of 42 ul was incubated at $40^{\circ}$ for $15 \mathrm{~min}$. Samples ( $5 \mathrm{Nl}$ ) were removed from the mixture and added directly to the appropriate activity assay (polymerase or RNase H). Control samples were taken from heat inactivation mixture at zero time to give the initial activity of the enzyme.

 first order reaction kinetics in experiments where the enzyme was preincubated without template-primer and the various substrates. As expected the time required for $50 \%$ loss of enzyme activity $\left(t_{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$ related to the preincubation temperature. The values for $t_{\frac{1}{2}}$ at $45^{\circ}, 40^{\circ}$, and $20^{\circ}$ were 2,4 , and $8 \mathrm{~min}$. respectively (Fig. 1). Similar experiments were carried out to monitor the mode![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_09_d37fdf89216115d1020dg-05.jpg?height=402&width=515&top_left_y=353&top_left_x=133)

of inactivation for RNase H. As shown in Fig. 2 the inactivation pattern distinctly differs from that of the polymerase. Calculation of the $E_{a}$ (energy of activation) from Arrhenius plots for the polymerase and RNase H activities gave values of $9.8 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$ and $59 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$ respectively.

Protection of AMV polymerase activity against heat inact ivation: It was of interest to investigate whether templates or template-primers protect the enzyme against heat inactivation and whether a correlation existed between the degree of protection and the presence of 3'-OH containing primer molecules. Considerable increase in protection was observed when templates were primed with their corresponding oligodeoxynucleotides. The greatest protections were observed with AMV 70S RNA primed with dT ${ }_{12-18}$ and with activated calf thymus DNA both of which are known to possess numerous primed regions. Native DNA protected the enzyme to an extent similar to that observed with single stranted polynucleotides. By contrast tRNA was not effective as a protective agent. The nature of the nucleic acid bases and suger moities showed no effect on the degree of protection.

Protection of AMV polymerase activity against heat inactivation by increasing concentrations of primed or unprimed $70 \mathrm{~S}$ AMV RNA: The degree of protection afforded by varying concentration of 70 SNA was investigated. Although this method does not permit calculation of binding constants, the dependence of residual activity on the concentration of the ligand .(70S RNA) can be used to show differences in the binding and stability of the enzyme-ligand complex. Protection against heat inactivation was shown to depend on increasing concentrations of 7OS RNA until a saturating level was reached. The plateau values were very similar to protection by single stranded polynucleotides (Fig. 3). Upon priming 70S RNA with oligo dT, a significant increase in protective ability was noted which was absent in parallel experiments using 70S( $\varepsilon A$ ). Such modified 70 SNA is known not to base

pair with synthetic oligo dT (2). Cooperative protection of DNA polymerase against heat inactivation by substrates: In these experiments the concentration of 70 S RNA was limited in order to detect cooperative effects of substrates against heat inactivation at $40^{\circ}$. As summarized in Table 2, presence of the four triphosphates protected the enzyme up to 20 percent of the control. Absence of one or two deoxytriphosphates resulted in considerable loss of the observed protective action. Complete protection was observed upon the addition of oligo dT primed $70 \mathrm{SN}$ RN to the four triphosphates, demonstrating that the action of the various components was greater than the sum of each component acting alone. DISCUSSION

Protection against thermal inactivation has been effectively used in studies dealing with binding of substrates to enzymes (10.11). The method is relatively simple and has the added advantage of requiring small amounts of protein. In such studies substrate analogues can also be used since they occupy the same site as that of the normal substrate on the enzyme. This report takes advantage of this simple technique and examines the preference of AMV DNA polymerase for its substrates. These experiments have shown that priming of single stranded polyribonucleotides is an essential requirement for enzyme recognition. The greater protection given by activated DNA in contrast to native DNA has further amplified these observations (Table 1) and are in complete agreement with our previously reported results (2). It is of interest to note that primed 70 S RNA binds to the enzyme to a greater extent than any synthetic primed templates including activated DNA (Fig. 3), indicating a preference of the AMV DNA polymerase to form a strong enzyme-ligand complex with its cognate substrate. However, upon chemical modification of intact $70 \mathrm{~S}$ RNA to its $\varepsilon$ A analogue and it.s subsequent priming, such protection could not be noted due to the inability of the modified adenine residues to base pair with oligo dT.

Since RNA dependent DNA polymerase is a multisubstrate enzyme, it was of interest to investigate the cooperative

protection by substrates against heat inactivation. The results presented in this report clearly show that template molecules protect the DNA polymerase activity and this protection was greater than the sum of the protective effect of each component acting along (Table 2). Protection against heat inactivation may be a useful assay for interaction between AMV DNA polymerase and the various substrates involved in the enzyme activity.

The heat inactivation experiments lead us to investigate the possibility of dissociating the polymerase from the nuclease (Rlase H) activity by heat treatment. Upon heating enzyme fractions at $40^{\circ}$ for $20 \mathrm{~min}$. RNase $\mathrm{H}$ activity was retained with a concomitant loss of the polymerase activity. Comparison of energy of activation for the polymerase activity Ea $=9.8 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$ and that for the RNase H Ea $=59 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$ shows a significant difference. This strongly suggests that few $1 \mathrm{f}$ any of the am1no acid residues which make up the respective active stes are shared. These results 1mply that the two act1vities have independent catalytic and perhaps binding sites. In addition to this treatment can be adapted as a procedure for the preparation of RNase $\mathrm{H}$ free of all polymerase activity.
